            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41194:4"/>him beſt, had abundant proof that he really was ſuch an one. He did timely ſhew himſelf to be an ingenious and apt <hi>Scholar</hi> in the <hi>Free-ſchool</hi> of that place of his <hi>Nativity;</hi> where the ſtrict and skilful Maſter encourag'd by his Fathers liberality, found him every way ready to receive inſtruction, till about the 10th <hi>year of his age,</hi> he was fitted for <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical</hi> Studies. When upon his Fathers frequent converſe with the Reverend and Pious Dr. <hi>Samuel Bolton,</hi> then the famous <hi>Lecturer</hi> of the <hi>Pariſh,</hi> and the worthy Maſter of <hi>Chriſt-Colledg</hi> in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> who had often examin'd him at his <hi>Fathers houſe,</hi> and found him not only very Religiouſly diſpos'd, but well accompliſht with School-learning; He was then remov'd to that Colledg under the <hi>Tutoridg</hi> of (him who was afterwards) Dr. <hi>Outram,</hi> who had a great value for him as long as he liv'd.</p>

So <hi>early</hi> did he begin to ſtartle at the committing of the leaſt ſin. For on a <hi>Lords-day</hi> going into the Work-houſe in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers yard, and there a little loitering, he heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly clapt his hand on a Tenter-hook, and <hi>tore his hand much.</hi> Whereupon he reſolv'd no more to miſ-ſpend his time on the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> but to addict
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41194:4"/>himſelf wholly to the <hi>Religious Obſervance</hi> of it; which reſolution he was known to keep ſtrictly ever after both at home and abroad.</p>

Truly it was ſo pleaſant that I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I wiſht I could have always liv'd in that ſtate, and was loth to leave this company. The next day reviewing the temper of his ſpirit, he notes, he was very freely carried out for the good of Saints: Whereupon he reſolv'd, <hi>firſt</hi> to mortifie carnal joy, in which he had been before immers'd; in that he found it very deſtructive to his ſpiritual
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41194:5"/>comfort; and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> to be more active for God in the company, to ſelect ſome out, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with them, to inflame their ſouls in love to God in Chriſt, and to the Children of God, praying for ſtrength thereunto from Heaven.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. <q>The next Lords-day after, he records to the exaltation of the riches of Gods grace, That he appeared very clearly to him as a Father in Chriſt. I may truly ſay, I never found ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the mortification of carnal joy, and carnal love, as then, when I was exceeding mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a ſenſe of love, and with the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Gods dealings with me. Further,</q>
               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. <q>If any would have me diſtinguiſh 'twixt <hi>carnal</hi> love, and <hi>ſpiritual;</hi> let them <hi>firſt</hi> conſider, that <hi>ſpiritual</hi> love is carried out only to a Saint, as the image of God appears in him; now <hi>carnal</hi> love to a Saint appears when it is upon account of a ſweet diſpoſition, humility, meekneſs, and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of body, uſually accompanied with a propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to laughter, and lightneſs of ſpirit; but <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> love is accompanied with abundance of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs of ſpirit, and compoſedneſs of mind, as I found at that time. <hi>Carnal</hi> love, and <hi>carnal</hi> joy in Saints, is a great rock againſt which they are very apt to run. You ſhall have <hi>Saints</hi> ſometimes ſo extaſied with joy, that they know not why, nor for what; and it is commonly in meltings of ſoul. 'Tis true, there may be the ſpirit there working, as he is often; and likewiſe there is the <hi>fleſh</hi> mixed with it, therefore 'tis good to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41194:6"/>that rapture of St. <hi>Paul</hi> carried into the <hi>third Heavens,</hi> where were things unutterable. There was joy with an high diſcovery of God; but thou waſt joyful, and (may be) ſaweſt nothing. Whence may be this Inference:</q>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. <q>That the more <hi>diſcovery of God and thine own nothingneſs,</hi> take them together; the joy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in upon ſuch diſcovery is the more <hi>ſpiritual;</hi> but the leſs the diſcovery of thoſe things, the more <hi>carnality</hi> in that joy. 'Tis true, it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon complaining of Saints, Oh I want <hi>comforts, joys,</hi> diſcoveries of love, and theſe they daily pray for; but becauſe they have them not ſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in as they us'd to be, they wonder. Alas! they little conceive, that there is ſome <hi>luſt,</hi> ſome corruptions that they cheriſh in their boſom, which ſupplies the room of grace and comfort; and therefore <hi>note,</hi> God doth or would do thee a greater kindneſs to ſubdue thy corruption, than in giving thee in the comfort thou prayeſt for.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="9">IX. <q>As to <hi>carnal</hi> love, mark whether thy love to other Saints comes from diſcovery of <hi>grace</hi> in them, or from the ſweetneſs of their <hi>diſpoſitions,</hi> (for the carriage and ſweetneſs of their natural temper is excellent) and be ſure the more love doth ariſe from the ſweetneſs of their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>diſpoſitions,</hi> the more that love is <hi>carnal,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch is common to any <hi>carnal</hi> man.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And as to the <hi>effect,</hi> that love which ariſeth from their carriage, doth decay and flag upon more familiarity with them; but <hi>ſpiritual</hi> love decays not, yea, it increaſeth by more acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41194:6"/>And again, <hi>ſpiritual</hi> love to Saints is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a compoſedneſs and ſerenity of ſoul; and doth not ſo much expreſs it ſelf in other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward joy, as in merrineſs of the countenance. The ſame may be ſaid of that <hi>ſpiritual</hi> love in ſoul to God; it is not ſo much carried out in joy, which is <hi>external,</hi> but in the <hi>inward</hi> man; and the more thy love is <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> and thy joy <hi>ſpiritual</hi> as to God, the more it is accompanied with a diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſelf-emptineſs and ſelf-vileneſs; and this kind of love is maſculine, and far more durable than that love which ariſeth from the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Gods love, and a leſs of ſelf-vileneſs.

                  <p n="33">XXXIII. <q>This may be the <hi>temper of ſome ſouls,</hi> that have had <hi>ſome aſſurance</hi> of their good eſtate; that if afterwards ſome ſin is ſet home up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41194:20"/>their ſouls, they are exceeding loth to <hi>dive into their own hearts,</hi> which is accompanied with this <hi>ſlaviſh fear,</hi> leſt they ſhould find all their former hopes to be meer flaſhes, and that they have been in a carnally <hi>ſecure ſtate</hi> even until now: ſome have div'd into their hearts at ſuch a time, and God hath ſhown them ſome <hi>hypocriſie,</hi> or <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> in their former walkings; whence they have concluded, that if God had let them die in ſuch a condition, they had been damn'd: and ſo after this diſcovery, if they have had a clearer diſcovery of the baſeneſs of their heart, they have concluded the like of that eſtate. By this kind of <hi>reaſonings</hi> there are theſe <hi>diſadvantages</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to ſuch a ſoul. <hi>Firſt,</hi> He can by no means make Gods former dealings with him ſubordinate to the innervating of his preſent condition; and without a ſpecial work of the divine Spirit, a man ſhall not gather any ground for his preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Secondly,</hi> By this he loſeth a praiſing Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and he alſo deals diſingenuouſly with God in not owning all his gracious diſpenſations to the ſoul. The <hi>direction</hi> that I would give <hi>ſuch an one,</hi> ſhould be this: <hi>Let him know that the leaſt grace is true grace:</hi> Grace in the <hi>ſeed</hi> is as <hi>true</hi> grace, as grace in the <hi>bud;</hi> and grace in the <hi>bud</hi> as <hi>true,</hi> as grace in the <hi>bloſſom:</hi> Shall the <hi>bloſſom</hi> contemn the <hi>bud,</hi> becauſe it is not ſo fragrant, and ſo flouriſhing, or the <hi>bud</hi> the <hi>ſeed?</hi> Oh! take heed of a <hi>non entertainment of divine Love.</hi> I have had ſuch <hi>quick checks of conſcience,</hi> that they have forc'd me to <hi>Duty,</hi> to <hi>Prayer,</hi> to <hi>Church,</hi> to <hi>Chappel, private Conferences;</hi> and now I am

                        <hi>Seeing that all the mercies of Saints have divine Love mingled among them: Now I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy worldly bleſſings, I know not whether they are given to me out of love to me,</hi> ſays ſome poor Saint.</q>

                     <q>There be theſe <hi>three marks</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a ſoul may ſee whether his earthly bleſſings are mingled with ſpiritual love. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Mark whether they were given to you upon the <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of prayer?</hi> Did you beg them of the Lord upon your knees? So that you may ſay all <hi>your mercies,</hi> are the children of your <hi>prayers,</hi> the births of your entreaties, your health, your meat and drink were wreſtled for at a Throne of Grace. After this manner did <hi>Hannah</hi> procure her ſon <hi>Samuel,</hi> as we may read [1 <hi>Sam. Chap.</hi> 1.] reflect now upon your ſelf, and ſee whether your
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41194:21"/>outward mercies come this way: if they do, O how ſweet and comfortable will they be to you: you ſhall never look conſiderately upon them, but your heart ſhall be warmed with the love of God. Here (you may ſay) is a <hi>mercy,</hi> and there is a <hi>bleſſing</hi> which I pull'd out of the boſome of divine Love (as it were) with mine own hand; <hi>this child,</hi> and <hi>that child, this crumb of bread,</hi> and <hi>that drop of drink</hi> are all pledges of <hi>Gods love</hi> to me: theſe are divine influences, and ſparks of the flames of Gods loving-kindneſſes. What <hi>Adaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> heart would not ſuch diſcoveries melt into love towards God? what ſoul would not ſuch <hi>chains of gold</hi> enraviſh, which were both made, and put about its neck with the lovely fingers of Chriſts hands? What ſoul would not ſuch a <hi>Cordial</hi> comfort, which is compounded of <hi>love</hi> and goodneſs? Mine heart is <hi>enraviſh'd</hi> within me whiles I think of this <hi>love;</hi> and every thought that I have of it beſpeaks admiration: this is that which <hi>Angels</hi> admire, and in which <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Saints</hi> are immers'd: theſe are the <hi>Chryſtal ſtreams</hi> which run before the <hi>throne of the Lamb;</hi> every drop of which preſents a jewel of ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble price: It is a thing rather to be admir'd than talk'd of: here I could be content to dwell to eternity, but I am call'd off to <hi>the ſecond mark,</hi> to diſcover <hi>this love in outward mercies;</hi> and that is this: Ask your ſoul this Queſtion, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it hath been drawn out in praiſes for that which you have received of God?</hi> Can you ſay that you <hi>love</hi> God the more for them? and do they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage you to <hi>ſerve</hi> God more? if they do, you
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41194:22"/>may aſſure your ſelf that <hi>Gods love is in every mercy you receive.</hi> Thirdly, Can you ſee them, <hi>given to you upon the account of Chriſt?</hi> Can you ſay, that God <hi>loves you</hi> in Chriſt, therefore God gives you <hi>this</hi> and <hi>that</hi> mercy? this is one of the higheſt attainments of a Saint on this ſide glory. This ſpeaks fulneſs of comfort. O! how ſweet is it to ſee a reconciled Father hold forth his hand full of mercies! to hear him come and ſay, <hi>Child,</hi> take this mercy, and that mercy! and when ever thou lookeſt upon them, remember that I love thee! O how pleaſant is ſuch a voice! This cannot but work up the ſoul to <hi>love God,</hi> and to breathe after God more than ever. It is hard to <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> betwixt an <hi>holy waiting</hi> upon God for the <hi>anſwer</hi> of our prayers; and a <hi>kind of ſecurity,</hi> which is apt to ſeize upon mens ſouls after prayer. Now for <hi>anſwer,</hi> conſider <hi>this:</hi> That <hi>waiting</hi> doth not impair breathings of ſoul after God; <hi>ſecurity</hi> doth. Again, <hi>Patience</hi> makes the ſoul more <hi>cautious</hi> of its walkings, to take heed of offending God: <hi>Security</hi> doth not. Let a man therefore in his <hi>waiting</hi> ſeek for an holy reſtleſneſs of ſoul after God. I found it in my practiſe hard to diſtinguiſh betwixt theſe two caſes, 1650.</q>

                  <p n="35">XXXV. <q>Men go to <hi>Ordinances,</hi> as <hi>Reading, Hearing, Praying,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and meet not God in them.</hi> The <hi>Reaſons</hi> of which diſtemper are, (1.) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the <hi>diſtraction</hi> of their thoughts in them, and that ariſeth from the temper, or rather di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of the ſoul exercis'd in thoughts of thoſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41194:22"/>things before they went, which in <hi>Ordinances</hi> do diſtract them. As for inſtance: Perhaps a mans <hi>ſtudies,</hi> or <hi>affairs</hi> of the world, and his thought of them diſtracts him: it's a ſign he had been thinking of theſe things, either immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came, or elſe his heart was too much car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out in the week-days after them. (2) Thine <hi>heart was hard</hi> when thou wenteſt to <hi>hear</hi> or read; and it's no wonder if the ſeed falling on rocky ground, that it do not grow up and bring forth fruit. (3) Becauſe thou wenteſt not with an open mouth, and an hungry ſoul to the <hi>Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> that's another reaſon, why thou art neither filled, nor art ſatisfied with divine Conſolations: few have gone to <hi>hearing</hi> with a full intent to hear what God would ſpeak to them there, and ſo have come away empty. It is ordinary for Saints in a <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>low</hi> eſtate to put up <hi>Petitions</hi> to God as low as they themſelves. They think it preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption to ask the great things promis'd, as <hi>Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Aſſurance,</hi> &amp;c. and they are apt to think they do well in it; then doubtleſs this came from an unbelieving heart, which would ſeal the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which God hath open'd, and cloſe thoſe arms which God hath ſpread open to receive ſinners, and to cover the breaſts of conſolation with a vail of modeſty, which God taketh not well at our hands. Many Saints will complain of their hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, liſtleſneſs to <hi>praying, reading, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> and this is the <hi>burthen</hi> which they lie under. Now if I were to adviſe ſuch a ſoul, it would be thus: Let him caſt all theſe diſtempers of ſoul upon his own ſelf as the cauſe of them. Let him
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41194:23"/>reflect upon his converſation: hath he <hi>walked cloſe with God?</hi> or hath he not <hi>given way to looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</hi> either in his <hi>carriage</hi> he hath been too light, or in his <hi>tongue</hi> too vain. If he ſay he hath <hi>ſet a watch</hi> over himſelf, and reſolv'd to <hi>walk more ſtrictly,</hi> and yet hath fal'n. <hi>Anſ.</hi> But didſt thou not firſt <hi>let fall thy watch,</hi> and then fall into ſin? or art thou not conſcious to thy ſelf, that thou could'ſt walk more ſtrictly if thou wouldſt? Thine own thoughts ſhall condemn thee; thy conſcience tells thee thou mayeſt <hi>pray</hi> more, if thou wilt; thou mayeſt <hi>read</hi> more, and <hi>meditate</hi> more on what thou readeſt, and pray more over what thou meditateſt, if thou wouldſt. O man, thy judgment herein is juſt!</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="36">XXXVI. <q>It is a general <hi>complaint of Saints,</hi> that they cannot get up their hearts as to <hi>mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the ſins of others.</hi> And for <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This may caſt down many a poor Saint: but I would have <hi>ſuch an one</hi> to take notice of what temper his ſoul is as to his <hi>own</hi> ſins; and if he finds his heart hard, and not able to mourn for his <hi>own ſins,</hi> it is no wonder if it mourns not for the ſins of others. So then I would have thy ſoul in <hi>this</hi> caſe, as thou wouldeſt in the <hi>other.</hi> Now as for thine <hi>own</hi> ſins, thou canſt ſatisfie thy ſelf as to this caſe, that thou canſt remember, God hath drawn thee out in a melting frame for them: So then think thou whether at any time, when thou haſt been in an <hi>humble melting temper,</hi> thou could'ſt then <hi>mourn for others ſins:</hi> But withall take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this, that a <hi>mourning temper for others
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41194:23"/>ſins,</hi> is an <hi>high attainment.</hi> Therefore pray thou for it, that thou mayeſt continually be in ſuch a temper; and that upon this account, becauſe <hi>thy God, thy Father is diſhonoured</hi> by their ſins; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for a tender regard to Gods glory. And as to mourn for the ſins of others, ſo it is hard in <hi>praying for another Saint,</hi> if one hears that ſoul hath received that which he prayed for, to believe that his prayers had an intereſt in his deliverance: and this is the reaſon why he cannot find his heart carried out in <hi>praiſes</hi> to God for the deliverance of that ſoul. Let ſuch a ſoul take up only this conſideration, and know that his <hi>prayers</hi> have as much influence upon <hi>another,</hi> as upon <hi>himſelf,</hi> and ſo let him reſolve himſelf. But in our <hi>praying for mortification or comfort</hi> in our ſouls, we are apt to miſcarry, in <hi>determining</hi> Gods <hi>time</hi> in our ſouls for the giving of it: As for <hi>inſtance;</hi> Suppoſe I pray for ſtrength againſt my paſſions, I am apt to determine Gods time to the <hi>next time</hi> I have an offer to my paſſion; and this occaſions great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to ſome who are apt to think that <hi>God did not hear,</hi> neither did <hi>Chriſt intercede,</hi> nor the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit help</hi> in that prayer. Therefore this is the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice I would give to all Saints in <hi>this caſe,</hi> let them <hi>pray for that which they want;</hi> but be ſure let them withall adjoyn <hi>patient waiting upon God to the giving in of an anſwer.</hi> Or thus: I would have a man be reſolv'd that God will give in an anſwer, but let him be <hi>undetermin'd as to the time.</hi> It is very difficult for a ſoul that hath been <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſtany particular corruption,</hi> and that for a long while; and yet finds his <hi>corruptions</hi> to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41194:24"/>him, or <hi>to get head,</hi> to perſuade himſelf that God hath <hi>heard</hi> his prayers, and that <hi>Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceded</hi> for thoſe prayers; yet thou maiſt know whether Chriſt interceded for thee in thoſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>Firſt,</hi> if thou art carried out in thy <hi>depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi> upon God, notwithſtanding theſe prayers are not anſwered directly, as to the conqueſt of thy <hi>particular corruption.</hi> Thus he dealt with <hi>Peter;</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt,</hi> I have <hi>pray'd that thy faith fail thee not.</hi> And that the prick in <hi>Pauls</hi> fleſh was not quickly took away, yet he had an anſwer, <hi>Gods grace was ſufficient for him. Secondly,</hi> If he keeps up thine heart in a <hi>continual praying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this corruption.</hi> For we muſt know, that <hi>every breathing of the ſoul after mortification,</hi> is purchaſed of the Father by the death and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If God anſwers thee as to the <hi>mortification of any corruption,</hi> though not in that which thou prayedſt againſt in particular. Suppoſe thou prayed'ſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>anger,</hi> or <hi>pride;</hi> perhaps God will <hi>anſwer</hi> thee in <hi>deadning thine heart to the world:</hi> and by <hi>theſe ſigns</hi> thou mayeſt diſcover the beams of love, though there be a cloud that interpoſeth.</q>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41194:29"/>of Auditors, 'twas evident his labours were much valued (though he had low thoughts of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of men); He was by the <hi>Pariſhioners</hi> (in whoſe power the preſentation or nomination then was) choſen to be <hi>Miniſter</hi> of <hi>Laurence Poult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> where he continued (and being then a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dower, and removing from the Houſe of his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friend Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> then marrying, liv'd in the family of his worthy friend Mr. <hi>Robert de Lunà</hi> Merchant) till the frowning <hi>Bartholomew</hi> 1662. when he was <hi>ejected thence,</hi> and out of his <hi>Lectures,</hi> as 2000 of his <hi>Brethren</hi> were elſewhere, becauſe they could not <hi>aſſent</hi> and <hi>conſent</hi> to <hi>all and every thing</hi> in the new <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Eſtabliſhment</hi> made then at the importunate inſtance of the <hi>Hierarchy.</hi> But at the motion of his friends to give them a <hi>Sermon</hi> that <hi>Saturday</hi> night, (before the ſevere Law was to be executed the next day,) he yielded, though they had not ſpoken to him till when <hi>he</hi> was that day at dinner; and a Text was named to him who ſoon after turn'd aſide to his Meditation, they rang the Bell, and he preached a <hi>farewell Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> (not that in the <hi>Printed</hi> ones on <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.5.) from that very <hi>Text</hi> given, <hi>viz.</hi> Mal. 3.16. <hi>Then they that feared the Lord, ſpake often one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Lord harkened and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought on his name.</hi> They knew it was not very difficult for him who was <hi>inſtructed to the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> like the houſholder, <hi>to bring forth out of his treaſure things new and old.</hi> He would often ſay to ſome of his friends (he bleſs'd God), if he had but a little

It might be truly ſaid of <hi>him,</hi> as 'twas of Mr. <hi>Hugh Latimer</hi> the Martyr: <hi>He did behave himſelf as a faithful meſſenger of God, being afraid of no man, telling all degrees their duties faithfully and truly, without reſpect of perſons, or any kind of flattery.</hi> Yet <hi>he</hi> did not much care to converſe with the <hi>Rich</hi> unleſs <hi>he</hi> could bring them to acts of <hi>Charity.</hi> When in the things of this world, which <hi>he</hi> had earneſtly deſired, <hi>He</hi> met with <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments,</hi> He would paſs them over without much concernedneſs. <hi>He</hi> was in <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> very mild, and would give way to <hi>others</hi> to ſpeak; and when he had heard them, he would <hi>without paſſion,</hi>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:41194:30"/>and with much judgment and clearneſs return an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to them. If he had heard any one <hi>good Chriſtian</hi> ſpeak <hi>bitterly</hi> againſt <hi>another Chriſtian;</hi> It was uſual with him to ſay, That the <hi>other like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meant better than he had expreſſed himſelf; and if what was ſaid, could be took in two ſenſes, it ought to be interpreted in the beſt, becauſe every Chriſtian cannot in ſuch a ready way utter his mind as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can. Inſomuch, that when a diſpaſſionate and more particular enquiry hath been made into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and he hath been deſired to explain himſelf, or another ſtanding by, hath put words into his mouth, it hath often been found he did not mean as at the firſt, the other apprehended he did.</hi> And therefore our Author would give this <hi>Rule</hi> upon another's ſaying or doing, <hi>If a good ſenſe can be put upon it, never take it in a bad one.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The cruel and bloody <hi>nature</hi> of his Death; here you may conſider the whole ſtory of his Arraignment, his being betrayed by his own Apoſtle, his being ſpit upon and crowned with thorns, his being mocked and jeered by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a <hi>reed</hi> into his hand inſtead of a <hi>ſcepter,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his bearing of a Croſs, and his being nailed to it in his hands and feet; after that, his being pierced through with a <hi>ſpear;</hi> this <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. will fully acquaint you with. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the <hi>cauſes</hi> of his Death; it was no natural diſeaſe, neither was it for any evil done of his own, but for us, <hi>He bore our iniquities upon the croſs.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>the effects of his death,</hi> which was to obtain power of his Father to conquer the Devil, and pull us out of his hands; to break our hearts, and to conquer us to himſelf, to pardon our ſins, and to give unto us eternal life with himſelf in glory, and this upon our faith and ſincere repentance. Now from all theſe things are your Meditations to be raiſed, before you come to the Sacrament, and when you are receiving of it.</p>
               <p>An <hi>Example of Meditation</hi> I have here ſet you down as followeth.</p>
               <p>Away theſe wanton wandering worldly <hi>thoughts,</hi> you are clogs to my ſoul. Away all trifling world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>buſineſs,</hi> I cannot now attend your call, my heart hath now ſomething elſe to do. Adieu my <hi>Friends,</hi> farewell my <hi>Husband, Wife</hi> and <hi>Child,</hi> I muſt go ſee <hi>my bleeding Lord,</hi> that's dearer to me than you all. Come now my ſoul, thou art a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, thou knoweſt the way, make haſt and ſpeed;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41194:52"/>look yonder, ſee how the people flock; croſs but this <hi>vale,</hi> and climb but up this <hi>Mount,</hi> thou wilt ſoon arrive at bloody <hi>Golgotha,</hi> where thou ſhalt ſee thy bleeding and dying Saviour to ſigh and linger out a dying life on the Croſs in love for thee. This, this might, <hi>Oh my ſoul,</hi> have been thy day, and thou might'ſt have been the priſoner; this I ſay <hi>might have been</hi> the day in which thou might'ſt have drunk the bitter cup of the fierce anger of God. But look yonder! there <hi>he</hi> goes that muſt drink up the dregs, and all for <hi>thee.</hi> Look again! there he goes that muſt lay down his life that thou maiſt be reprieved. But come, <hi>my ſoul,</hi> draw up a little nearer, thou canſt not ſee him well at ſo great a diſtance; ſtand here and thou wilt ſee him paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; look there he goes with a train of Virgins following. But ſee how cruelly theſe barbarous <hi>Jews</hi> do uſe him, they make him bear his Croſs himſelf, and preſs his wearied fainting limbs above his ſtrength; ſee how they laugh and ſcoff, and wag their heads as if he were their <hi>May-game.</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks my heart boils up with rage to ſee theſe cruelties revenged. Oh! how could the bleſſed God forbear to ſee his bleſſed Son thus wronged? Why did he not ſend twelve Legions of Angels for his reſcue? Why doth he not ſend down fire from Heaven upon the heads of theſe his Sons enemies, and ſo conſume them? But ſtay <hi>my foeliſh heart, thou knoweſt not what ſpirit thou art of;</hi> this debt was owing, and it muſt be paid; God requires <hi>ſo much,</hi> and it muſt be given, or thou canſt not be ſaved. Thy Lord did know this well enough, for this he came from Heaven, and committed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41194:53"/>to the rage of men; he knew he muſt endure all theſe revilings, and doth it grieve thy ſoul to ſee him thus abaſed? Stay but a while, and thou ſhalt ſee him more; look up, <hi>my ſoul,</hi> come, tell me what thou ſeeſt? Oh I cannot, ſorrow tyes my tougue, I cannot ſpeak; I ſee and hear thoſe things that I want a power to utter. I ſee a <hi>troop of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins</hi> following him, their <hi>weeping eyes,</hi> their <hi>blub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering lips,</hi> their <hi>ſighs</hi> and <hi>throbbings</hi> ſpeak them mourners. I ſee my Lord looks towards them, and kindly chides their loving ſorrow, <hi>Why weep ye, Oh ye Daughters of Jeruſalem? weep not for me.</hi> My Lord! what need was there for that queſtion? Should not they <hi>weep</hi> when thou muſt <hi>bleed?</hi> Would not their eyes have been flints if that <hi>then</hi> they ſhould not drop <hi>tears</hi> for thee, when as thou wert about to pour out thy <hi>life</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> for them? Ah! could they chuſe, or do leſs then weep to ſee thine innocent ſelf among a herd of <hi>Tygers!</hi> what ſhould a <hi>Lamb</hi> do there? they ſaw thee in their ravenous jaws about to tear thy heart, to ſuck out all thy blood, and leave thee dead. Have I not ſat and read, and read and wept in viewing over the ſtory; and could they forbear that with their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try eyes ſaw this ſcene then <hi>acted?</hi> But whither, O whither, O ye blinded <hi>Jews,</hi> are ye dragging this my Lord? My ſpirit begins to faint, I now can look no longer, my heart now begins to ſwell with grief, it muſt now break, or I muſt vent it at mine eyes in ſtreams! Look! ſee the Hammer and Nails, the Hammer lift up to ſtrike. Bloody man! thou durſt not ſure; ſurely thou doſt not know <hi>whoſe</hi> hands and feet thou art now piercing; it is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41194:53"/>the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Saviour of the world</hi> Fooliſh heart! ſee how thou art miſtaken; look, ſee it's done, the nails are driven to the head! ſee how the <hi>crimſon tears</hi> run trickling down his hands and feet, and ſee how hardened hearts be laughing at it! Oh ſilly fooliſh blinded men! what laugh you at? This very <hi>Chriſt</hi> whom now you mock, ſhall be your <hi>Judg;</hi> this very man <hi>Jeſus</hi> whom you have <hi>thus abuſed,</hi> ſhall come attended with thouſands of Angels, with the ſound of Trumpets, and ſhall ſit upon your <hi>life</hi> and <hi>death.</hi> Him whom you now have nailed to a Croſs, <hi>hath God exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour.</hi> What then will you do when that great and terrible day of the Lord ſhall come? How will you look him in the face whom you have <hi>ſpit on?</hi> How will you dare to ſpeak a word for your ſelves to him whom you have <hi>nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a tree</hi> and <hi>crucified?</hi> His wounds in <hi>hands, ſide</hi> and <hi>feet</hi> ſhall all bear witneſs againſt you, and his <hi>innocent blood</hi> that you have ſpilt ſhall cry aloud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the throne for vengeance againſt you; your <hi>flouts</hi> ſhall then be turned into <hi>tears,</hi> and your <hi>taunts</hi> into <hi>lamentations.</hi> And how will you then look and cry when God paſſeth ſentence on you, and thruſt you down to Hell to bear the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your ſins? this is the Lord that came to ſpare your lives, yet your wickedneſs ſpared not his; and how at length can you think to eſcape with yours?</p>
               <p>But once again, look up, <hi>my ſoul,</hi> and ſee what is become of thy <hi>nailed</hi> and <hi>crucified Lord:</hi> Ah me! he is not <hi>quite</hi> dead, look how he gaſps and pants for life! Oh how his looks are changed!
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41194:54"/>How pale and wan do I ſee his cheeks! the blood and all the ſpirits are quite drawn from them. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks he ſhould be dead, for ſee how weak his <hi>neck</hi> is grown, that it is not able to ſupport his <hi>head</hi> that lyes a dying on his <hi>bleeding breaſt.</hi> What yet not <hi>dead!</hi> ſee how he ſhakes and ſtirs his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing limbs! what <hi>gaſps</hi> and <hi>groans</hi> do I hear him fetch, as if his ſoul were ſtrugling to get out Hark, hark, he <hi>ſpeaks!</hi> Oh let me catch the laſt breath of my dying Saviour. What ſaith my Lord? Hark, what doſt thou not hear! what? <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> I am amazed to hear theſe words. How couldſt thou ſuſpect thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers love? How could he be <hi>far from thee,</hi> who was <hi>one with thy ſelf?</hi> But Oh! this is but the voice of his <hi>Manhood,</hi> and not of his <hi>Godhead.</hi> It was the voice of the dying and bleeding <hi>Man Jeſus,</hi> not the voice of the <hi>God Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, <hi>Oh my Lord,</hi> what are thoſe pains and gripes thou feeleſt, that brings forth theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainings? But why do I ask this queſtion? hath he not been all this while a drinking up the cup his Father gave him, the bitter, and ſowr, and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous cup of his Fathers wrath, which I and all the world had elſe drunk of? he juſt now ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down the laſt mouth full of the dregs, whoſe <hi>bitter noiſome taſte</hi> hath ſent forth theſe <hi>doleful la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations;</hi> for mark, he had no ſooner ſpoke theſe words, but he gaſped his laſt.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>The cauſes of his Death.</head>
                  <p>And muſt the <hi>Son of God</hi> be humbled thus?
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41194:54"/>muſt he that was from everlaſting, raiſed and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced <hi>above every name in heaven and earth;</hi> he that lay in the arms and breaſt of God, loved by the Father, and his <hi>only Son;</hi> honoured, adored, admired and beloved of ten thouſand times ten thouſands of Angels; But muſt <hi>this God</hi> leave all this glory, and change that ſweet Heavenly and delightſome <hi>Palace</hi> for ſo mean, ſo low, ſo dirty a <hi>cottage,</hi> as to be born a <hi>man.</hi> And muſt his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment at firſt be no better than a <hi>ſtable</hi> or a <hi>manger</hi> could give him? No ſooner muſt he begin to live, but muſt an enemy aſſault his life? Muſt he travel up and down this earth, and ſpend his time and ſtrength in preaching <hi>glad tidings</hi> to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable undone men, and fill the world with <hi>ſigns and wonders,</hi> and not deſerve ſo much of men as a houſe to dwell in, or a hole to put his head in? and after all this humble, holy, long-ſuffering life, muſt he be thought of by this unthankful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing world as one not worthy to live, and not have a breathing in that air which he both made and gave them to breathe in? but muſt he at length be laid hold of by a traiterous <hi>Judas</hi> that he had once taken for one of his own Apoſtles; and muſt he ſuffer all this? But ah! alas! what is this? muſt he be alſo <hi>crowned with thorns,</hi> and muſt he <hi>ſweat</hi> and <hi>bleed?</hi> Oh far more than tongue can utter! Oh aſtoniſhing condeſcenſion! thus did the <hi>Son</hi> become a <hi>ſervant,</hi> and learn'd obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by his ſufferings, and ſerved a <hi>three and thirty years apprenticeſhip</hi> in the pain and travel of his ſoul here on earth, a longer time than <hi>Jacob</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for his beloved <hi>Rachel,</hi> and that becauſe he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41194:55"/>loved us better, and therefore gave a better dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for us. But had I lived to have ſeen this <hi>Prince of Glory</hi> thus diſguis'd, this <hi>Eaſtern Sun</hi> thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighted in a cloud, this glorious God thus wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up in rags of fleſh, ſhould I have known him, or not? my ſenſual heart, I doubt thee much; wouldſt thou have cleaved to him &amp; loved him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than thy life, and have ſaid, <hi>Though all leave thee, I will not;</hi> and with <hi>Paul, I am willing and ready not only to be bound, but to die for thee.</hi> What thinkſt thou, Oh <hi>my ſoul!</hi> couldſt thou have left Husband, Wife, Father and Mother, and all the reſt of thy friends, and have ſold all that thou haſt, and followed him? what him whom the <hi>Prophet</hi> foretold, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.23. <hi>He hath no form or comelineſs in him, that you ſhould deſire him: he is deſpiſed and rejected of men, a man of ſorrows and acquainted with griefs.</hi> Tell me, tell me, couldſt thou have divorced thy ſelf from all, and have taken this ſeemingly uncomely perſon for thy <hi>Lord,</hi> and only <hi>Husband?</hi> Ah me! I do not know my heart; but ſurely had I known him as I do now know him, I ſhould not have ſtuck at any thing for him. For what if his <hi>Face</hi> did want <hi>comelineſs,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it came ſo with tears and grief for thee? and wilt thou love thy friend the worſe, becauſe he ſhares in ſorrow with thee? for thou canſt not but know that he came from Heaven to take to himſelf a Spouſe on Earth; and if I was one that he loved, and grieved for to ſee my ſtubborn heart ſo hard to yield, was this the cauſe he wanted beauty? Oh ſuch a want as this is lovely, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks my heart could have cleaved the cloſer to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41194:55"/>him: <hi>There was no beauty or comelineſs in him;</hi> and what of that? my ugly and deformed ſoul deſerves more loathing; my <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> the comelieſt part about me is but <hi>rags,</hi> or a <hi>menſtruous cloth;</hi> if there were no more deſirableneſs in him than in me, Oh had I loved him then, and left all for him, it were no wonder: but that he ſhould love me, I rather ſtand amazed! There was no <hi>beauty</hi> in him, it may be ſo; but could it be otherwiſe expected from him who came to work in <hi>fire and ſmoke,</hi> who came to quench the flames of Hell, and to ſatisfie Gods wrath and juſtice? to pull out filthy ſouls from the jaws of luſtful ſenſual fleſh and blood? it was not <hi>beauty</hi> but <hi>ſtrength</hi> that was here need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. A glance of an <hi>amorous eye</hi> would not have wounded <hi>Satan,</hi> and made him fall from Heaven like a flaſh of Lightning. A <hi>comely countenance</hi> could not have inchanted and unbar'd <hi>Hell-gates,</hi> and made them fall, and break before him into ſhatters. What need a <hi>fair hand</hi> to touch our fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>rotten ſouls,</hi> and take them up in menſtruous blood, and waſh them clean; or what need ſuch clean hands to claſp about the <hi>ruſty iron gates</hi> wherein I and all the world lay bound in chains, and to pull them down, to take our cankered bolts and knock them off; to take us by the hand to help us up, and lead us out? Alas! there needs no ſuch <hi>eye, face,</hi> or <hi>hand</hi> for ſuch a work. It is powerful, all-conquering ſtrength that is here required. It was a powerful victorious arm that here was nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſuch a one he had. But what ſhould he do with a <hi>beauteous body</hi> that muſt be ſo abaſed and <hi>abuſed</hi> as his was? an uncomely face will ſerve
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41194:56"/>where it muſt be <hi>ſpit on.</hi> What muſt he do with a <hi>fair ſoft delicate tender hand,</hi> which muſt be <hi>pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced?</hi> another kind of hand is good enough to <hi>knock a nail into.</hi> And what needs his body be of a clear, white, thin tranſparent skin? will not any ſerve that body that muſt be bruiſed and wounded as his was; nay, as it was neceſſary his ſhould be? But why thus neceſſary? either he muſt be thus dealt with, or elſe my ſin cannot be pardoned. Either he muſt be deſpiſed of men, or I <hi>muſt be of God.</hi> Oh he muſt drink up this bitter cup with all its dregs, or elſe I muſt have drunk it up my ſelf. It was I that ſinned, and I muſt have ſuffered: this curſed, proud and earthly heart of mine rebelled and broke the Laws, and ſhould have ſuffered and born the puniſhment; had not he ſtept in and born the ſtroke off from me, I had been now burning in everlaſting flames, and have been lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering out this time in torment, which I am now ſpending in the ſweet thoughts of my eſcape. And is not this all true? ſpeak out, <hi>my ſoul;</hi> hath not the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſaid as much? <hi>Surely</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he hath born our griefs, and carried our ſorrows: he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities, the chaſtiſement of our peace lay upon him, and by his ſtripes we are healed. All we like ſheep are gone aſtray, we are every one turned to his own way, and the Lord hath laid upon him the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of us all. He was oppreſſed, he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; he was brought as a lamb to the ſlaughter, and as a ſheep before the ſhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers was dumb, ſo he opened not his mouth. He was taken from priſon and judgment, and who ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41194:56"/>his generation? for he was cut off from the land of the living. And for the tranſgreſſion of my people was he ſmitten.</hi> Thou ſeeſt thy <hi>debt,</hi> and thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours <hi>payment</hi> of it; theſe are no fictions; thou haſt juſt now read a <hi>ſure word of Prophecy</hi> that hath confirmed it. Thoſe <hi>wounds,</hi> thoſe <hi>ſtripes,</hi> thoſe <hi>bruiſes</hi> which thou readeſt of, he bore for thee, and which were due to thee. It was thou that ſhouldſt have been led <hi>from priſon to judgment,</hi> from priſon to the Judgment-ſeat of the great God, who ſhould have ſat as Judg; he ſhould have arraigned thee, ſentenced thee, and have ſent thee to the <hi>ſlaughter-houſe of Hell,</hi> where thou ſhouldſt have been weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of thy teeth. But Oh amazing love and grace! the Son of God that loved me better than his life, ſtept off his Throne and took my nature on him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a man like to me (only ſin excepted) he came and bid me comfort my trembling heart, he would put himſelf in my condition, and become the priſoner; and if my ſin would coſt his <hi>life,</hi> he would freely part with it. Methinks I feel my bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els turn, my ſpirits melt within me; was ever love like to his love? he was a ſtranger to me: why did he not let me die? It was his Father I did wrong, why did he not let me ſuffer? What if my puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was as great as Hell? ſurely I did deſerve it. What if my pains and ſcreeches were eternal? Ah! I was a creature, a worm, a fly, a nothing to him, and what need he have cared? but he loved me; and could he love a priſoner at the Bar? I was a <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> a <hi>vile polluted</hi> one, methinks he ſhould have <hi>loathed</hi> me; but he did <hi>waſh</hi> thee, and make thee
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41194:57"/>clean again. I, but I was his Fathers <hi>enemy,</hi> and ſo no friend to him; or would he love an enemy? or did he not know ſo much? but how could that be, when he ſaw my heart, and the enmity that was in it? yes, he did, and yet he loved thee; <hi>even while we were enemies he died for us.</hi> But why did he love an enemy? or how could he do it? I know not why, it is paſt my reaſon to imagine it: <hi>Oh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible love!</hi> Oh love paſt <hi>thought!</hi> I cannot fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom thee with my reaſon, thy ways are unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; <hi>he loves becauſe he will love.</hi> And though his love diſpleaſeth us, yet it pleaſeth him to love us. What ails my heart? I cannot find it ſtir? What, dead under the reviving thoughts of thy deareſt Redeemer! I juſt now ſaid, he loved thee though an enemy, and when thou lovedſt not him; I ſee the enmity is not quite remov'd, thou canſt not love him yet: Ariſe, ſhake up thy ſelf, and look about thee, thou doſt not ſure ſee thy mercy; ſurely thou underſtandeſt not what thou oughteſt to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. Come away, Oh come away, lift up thy drowſie head, I will make thee look and love, while I ſet thee all on burning, and make thee ere I leave thee confeſs thou loveſt him. Think, think, <hi>Oh my ſoul,</hi> that thou hadſt juſt now ſinned and broke that law which threatned death, and upon the breach doth find thee guilty. Think that thou ſaweſt a flaming Cherubim, a meſſenger of the Court of Heaven flirt in at that door and arreſt thee for High treaſon, and give thee a ſummons to riſe from the ſeat thou ſitteſt on, to make a ſudden anſwer for thy life. Look then, my ſoul, Ah! I lookt juſt now, I ſee that door wide open: What's
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41194:57"/>this! a <hi>ſpirit?</hi> Ah me, I am undone, for I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned! I think the room ſhakes under me, or elſe 'tis my heart that's trembling. What's this I hear! I muſt now anſwer for my life: Oh what ſhall I ſay! I know not what; I have ſinned, my Conſcience tells me that I have ſinned, the witneſs within will caſt me, I ſee the Inditement writ with blood on my heart.; the pride, ſenſuality, and the earthli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of which I am charged with, I am not able to deny one tittle. Oh for a mountain to cover me: Oh whither ſhall I go, whither ſhall I fly? That Bed, theſe Curtains, this Cloſet cannot hide me. My Mother, Father, Wife or Child, cannot help me: O who then ſhall? I run whither I know not; vengeance will find me out where ever I go. Oh curſed and ſubtil <hi>Satan!</hi> are all thy fair promiſes and inticements come to this! O my wicked curſed fooliſh <hi>heart!</hi> that ever I ſhould believe him before my Creator, that told me, <hi>the day I ſinned I ſhould ſurely die.</hi> Oh that for a little ſimple tranſient pleaſure I ſhould ſo madly hazard my eternal life! and now I muſt be caſt to Hell to bear the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my folly. Think once again, think that this were the day, and this the very place in which God ſhould come and ſit in Judgment on thee. Methinks I ſee the Heavens bow themſelves: Oh what a crackling do I hear in the Clouds; look yonder! ſee who comes! it is <hi>my Judg;</hi> his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance is as a flame of fire, he utters his voice like Thunder, the mountains skip, or rather ſhake, or rather tremble. Now, now, is the time of my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſtruction near at hand. Oh how ſhall I look him in the face! his looks do already affright me!
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41194:58"/>I ſhall not ſay one word, and I have not one friend that will ſay one word for me. It's true, I ſee a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible glorious Troop of Angels that do attend him, but they are all his friends, and therefore all my enemies: I dare not ſpeak a word to them; and alas! if I ſhould, they are all but his ſervants, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures with my ſelf; alas! they cannot, yea they will not help me. It's true, there is <hi>one,</hi> that <hi>one</hi> that ſeems <hi>as one with God,</hi> the beams of whoſe countenance are far brighter than all the Hoſt of Heaven: Beſides, if God have a Son, it may be it is he; methinks he is a <hi>mirrour</hi> of his Fathers Glory; but this I know not; be what he will, he cannot pity me a ſinner, the doors of hope are all ſhut up, and now as a miſerable wretch I muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to hear my ſentence; the <hi>Judg</hi> is ſet, and with trembling heart and joints I ſtand a <hi>priſoner</hi> at the bar for my life, and now I muſt attend his call.</p>

What ſays my heart to this? Methinks the very thoughts of it do make my heart to quiver, and my fleſh to ſhake all round about me; I feel no ſtrength in all my joints.</p>

                  <p>But think again, that the Devil did take hold of thee, and drag thee from the place thou ſitteſt on, to Hell; ſuppoſe the Father frowning on thee, and all the Angels ſhouting thee down to Hell, and glorying in thy damnation; but think again thou ſaweſt when all were joying to ſee thee ſentenced to Hell, that he that ſat juſt by the Judg, whom thou thoughteſt even now to be his Son, but knew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt it not. Look! look! methinks I ſee him riſe off his Throne; ſee, ſee, how the Angels fall to adore him, methinks he is a coming near thee.

                     <hi>The Sinner ſpeaks again.]</hi> Oh thou glorious God or Angel, or I know not what to call thee, do not delude or deride a poor Caitiff wretch in the midſt of miſery: Why wilt thou raiſe me to ſuch a pinacle of hope, to caſt me down, and make my fall the greater? My Judg hath paſſed the ſentence, I muſt die; and who can reverſe the doom? Ah! I muſt go; ſee my priſon-door wide open; the ſmoke and flaſhes come to meet my deſpairing ſoul half way.</p>

Doſt thou not ſee I have left my Throne, and am come down to the Bar where thou ſtandeſt condemned? But why doſt thou weep? Come, let me wipe thine eyes, and bind up thy bleeding and deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart: I tell thee, thou ſhalt not die: If Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will have blood, it ſhall have mine, ſo it will but ſpare thine. Sinner, if thou kneweſt who I am, thou wouldſt not doubt one tittle: I tell thee I am his <hi>Son,</hi> his <hi>only Son,</hi> that but now condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee: I know he is juſt, and juſtice muſt be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. But do not thou fear, if one of us muſt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41194:60"/>die, it ſhall be I: I will pour out my blood a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for ſin, and appeaſe his wrath, and make you friends again. Ye innumerable company of Angels, (yet ſervants at my Fathers will) why do ye rejoice to ſee my priſoner ſent to Hell? this curſed ſoul over whom in glory you do now tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, I do reſolve to die for, and to buy her to my ſelf a Spouſe, and to make her bleſſed with your ſelves, and give her a <hi>Princeſs's place</hi> on a Throne that is by my ſelf.</p>

What! for the Son of God to debaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo low as to take my nature, and ſo my cauſe, and become the priſoner! What! and though he knows he ſhall be caſt! Will he hear the ſentence, and quietly bear bolts, and ſhackles, and chains, which ſhould have fettered me? Yet more than this, Doth he know it is impoſſible to get a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve from his Father and Judg? and that he muſt moſt aſſuredly drink the bittereſt dregs of Death, more bitter than Devils or damned ſouls in Hell as yet ever taſted of? For it is impoſſible the Cup ſhould paſs: And can he, will he, dare he venture? But ſtay, I muſt be a Spouſe! to be exalted from this Dunghil to be a <hi>Princeſs</hi> to the Son and Heir of Glory! Hold, hold, here's enough, it is a Dream, an idle fancy of a diſtempered brain; I ſhall never find a heart to believe one ſyllable. But yet, methinks, if it be a dream, 'tis a Golden one.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41194:60"/>Is it poſſible that ſuch a damned wretch as I, could harbour ſuch ſilken gilded thoughts of ſuch love, grace, mercy and tenderneſs of the Son of God?

Could they ſo victoriouſly conquer all my fear, ſilence all my doubts, allay the heats of a ſcorched and be helled Conſcience? But why a dream, poor wretched heart?

I am not now in Hells torments, whither I was juſt now ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: My heart is now at eaſe and quiet; ſurely ſomething muſt be the reaſon why the Devil that but now had hold of me, hath left me. Where is the Conſcience that but now was burning in me? But Oh, cannot the preſence of the Lord put me out of doubt? Do not his words that were ſo kind, his tender dealing with me, doth not his ſtooping to me, taking me by the arm, and the gentle lifts that he gives to my drooping ſoul, ſpeak him preſent? Oh! do not my head, eyes, arms, heart, breaſt, and the eaſe of every joint and limb about me, witneſs the ſame?

Come, tell me, doth not Heaven look as though it was pleaſed with the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of his Son? What cloud or darkneſs doſt thou ſee about the Throne? what ſign or token of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure canſt thou at all diſcover? Open thine eyes, view the God of Glory. Do his looks beſpeak him to be thy Father or thy Judg? And canſt thou not read both Husband, Father and Lord, and all in his countenance? What not ſee it! ſurely thou art blind: If he had not told as much from his own mouth, his eyes and looks beſpeak his love and favour loud and clear enough to thee. But doth he not tell thee, to put thee out of all doubt, this is my well beloved Son, hear him, hear him: what's that? believe him whatſoever he ſays: why, what ſaith he? O dull and ſtupid heart! haſt thou forgot already! He ſaid he will pay his life for thine; and doth not his Father bid thee hear him? He ſaid he would reconcile thee, love thee, and make thee friends again; And is it not comfort when the Father bids thee believe him: he ſaid, he will pardon, waſh and cleanſe thee, and take thee to himſelf, and betroth thee to him for ever, and after all will give thee to ſee his Glory, even the ſame Glory which he had before the world. And the Father is willing to all this, for he tells thee his Son is his well-beloved Son, and bids thee believe him, and miſdoubt not one ſyllable. And canſt thou after all this doubt that the Father is not will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But do not his Angels likewiſe, who are mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring ſpirits, with voice and looks proclaim as much,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41194:63"/>that Heaven is well pleaſed with the Son, and with his Death and Paſſion, and ſo with thee in him. Do not the Angels admire the myſtery of Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace, that makes them ſo deſirous to peep into it? Why did they proclaim his coming into the world, and ſing for joy that there was good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will in Heaven to men on earth? or why do they ſo diligently attend thee by night and by day? Thou ſeeſt them not keep guard about thy Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-door, and round about the curtains of thy bed. Why do they attend thee from room to room, and follow thee down ſtairs, and out of doors, if it were not but that thou art ſome great Princeſs nearly allied to their Lord and Maſter? Thou doſt not ſee this, blame then thine eyes, and the infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of thy heart; ſhall it be leſs true, becauſe thy baſe infidelity cannot digeſt it? Thou might doubt God, Heaven, and every thing elſe on that ſcore; but haſt thou not it from his own mouth, that the Angels are miniſtring ſpirits for the heirs of glory? Come, tell me, I ſay, tell me quickly, I muſt have an anſwer, Can this, and all this be true, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven yet not be pleaſed? If God with his Son and Angels be all content that thou ſhouldſt be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ſo exalted to ſuch dignities as to be heir unto the Crown of Heaven; if theſe be pleaſed, who is there in Heaven that can elſe be diſpleaſed? What ſaith my heart? what, not yet one word? Oh how long ſhall I be troubled and peſtered with thy unbelief! Oh my God, ſtrike, chide, and break this flint, reprove this ſtubborn and unbelieving heart, I cannot perſwade it that thou loveſt me, or art willing to love me: I urge thy word, and my

Oh break, I pray thee, this <hi>Flint</hi> or <hi>Adamant</hi> upon thy <hi>downy breaſt</hi> of love; ſtrike, and one blow of thine will make it fall in pieces, and confeſs at length that thou art well pleaſed with thy Son, and fully ſatisfied that he ſhould bleed and die for me. But let me try thee once again, if thou haſt loſt thine ears and eyes, I'le ſee if thou haſt loſt thy feeling too. Thou ſayeſt thou canſt not believe that God is willing to accept the Son for thee, or that thou ſo vile a wretch canſt be accepted of by the Father through the merits of his Death and ſufferings. Come, tell me, is not this thy language? I know thou dareſt not to ſpeak ſo much in words. But ah! my <hi>Heart,</hi> I find thou haſt got a <hi>Tongue</hi> as well as my <hi>Mouth,</hi> that often mutters and ſpeaks a different language. But tell me if thy unbelief hath any ground for it? What makes it then that thy ſelf is ſo free from fears and terrours, when thou ſhouldſt believe the Almighty, of thy Bodies Death, Reſurrection, and coming to Judgment, if thou thoughteſt him not thy friend, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to thee in his Son? if not, methinks thy fears ſhould fright thee, and trembling ſeize on every joint; and yet thou wilt fooliſhly mutter againſt thine own feeling.</p>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41194:66"/>and reſolutely, that ten thouſands have rather choſen to loſe their lives, than the truth of them. Now put all theſe together, and tell me, canſt thou doubt? Away, I ſee thou doſt but trifle; confeſs the truth, or I am reſolved to heed thee no longer. Come, take and embrace that crucified Jeſus, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all things elſe but as loſs, and droſs, and dung in compariſon with him; ſtick not at his outward meanneſs, ſcruple not at his ignominious dying, it is the very Chriſt the Saviour of the world. Oh why ſhouldeſt-thou thus torment me? Doſt thou not ſee all thy fellow-Chriſtians to glory in that Croſs, and in that Chriſt that died on it? Do they not bear it as a badg of honour, and ſhall it be to thee as ſhame. Do not all the Chriſtian World eat and drink as often as they can the Symbols of this their dying Lord? And do they not all ſing, and joy, and triumph in it? and wilt thou the while lye vexing thy ſelf over a company of needleſs fears and ſcruples? Farewell all needleſs doubts and tormenting queſtions, I ſee my <hi>faith</hi> is built on a Rock, blow winds, beat waves, you cannot now remove me. Bleſſed God! I thank thee for thy. Son, thou haſt given his life for the ſpoiler, thou haſt bowed his back to the enemies, long furrows have they plowed upon it, and the day of his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity they laughed at. Lord! thou haſt wounded him for my ſins, and bruiſed him for my iniquities. Theſe ſpeak the depth of thy counſels, and the ways of thy mercy paſt finding out, and the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of thy Bowels. Thou haſt made him my Rock, and my ſhield, and my ſtrong tower, and in the day of my ſorrow through him thou wilt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41194:66"/>hear me. To thee, O God, will I make my vows, and to thee will I pay them; I will humble my ſelf before thee. I will always lye at the feet of my Redeemer. Lord! his Croſs and his ſhame ſhall be no more a ſtumbling-block to me, I will take it up and follow him, it ſhall be my Crown, my Song, and the glory of my rejoicing. I will enter into thy Courts with joy, and in the Congregations of thy Saints ſhall be my delight; I will remember thy loving-kindneſſes of old, and the days in which thou didſt afflict thy only Son for the ſins of my Soul. I will call to mind the <hi>Covenant</hi> of thy <hi>Grace;</hi> and my heart ſhall praiſe thee, when I ſee it foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on blood. Then will I betroth my ſelf to thy Son; join thou, Lord, both our hands and hearts, and we will ſtrike up a match for ever. Praiſe thou the Lord, Oh my ſoul, and all you that love and fear him, praiſe his holy name.</p>

                     <p>Lord, where am I! What! all the Children of the Bride-chamber up and dreſt, and I ſlumbering in my bed! Tell me ye faireſt, what make you up ſo early? Alas our Lord was up before us all. He called us up by break of the day, and wondered that we were not triming our lamps, knowing with whom we were to feaſt this day. Oh! well then I will riſe up too. Oh what a ſhew do theſe bright and glittering Saints make in mine eyes? What a brightneſs do theſe pearls and diamonds caſt in mine eyes! they do ſtrike me into amazement. Oh
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41194:67"/>what a lovely humble look doth crown their brow? and what a comely countenance hath joy and <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly delight</hi> caſt on their <hi>cheeks?</hi> ſurely they did not thus dreſs themſelves, it was my Father that made them thus prepar'd to entertain his Son. But where are my Clothes? Now for the faireſt, ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt robe of thoughts and wiſhes that can be found, or that the wardrobe of my Father can afford me. Oh how naked am I! But where are my <hi>ſilken golden twiſts of Faith to hang the jewels of joy, and love, and humility upon?</hi> I am never dreſt till they be on. Oh where, where are they? I ſaw them by me but juſt now. I laid them by my heart before I went to bed. Oh what was I ſo long a reaſoning about? Oh what long and many threds did my reaſon ſpin even now, but to make theſe twines to tye up my joy, and to raiſe up my love, and to hang my Heavenly delight upon? But ah! I fear this envious world hath with her vanities ſtollen them away, or hid them from me; or the envious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, or unbelief have been ravelling or ſnarling of them, that now I am as far to ſeek as ever. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, O whither ſhall I go to find them out? Now will the Bridegroom come, and I am not ready; I cannot, dare not go to day. Now will my Lord be angry, and ask me why I came not, and I have no anſwer to make him. And if I go undreſt, he will ask me, where is my Wedding-garment, and then I ſhall be ſpeechleſs. Ah fooliſh ſimple heart! that thou wouldſt take no more care but to let theſe thoughts of earth ſo intangle themſelves with thy ſo pure and Heavenly contemplations! Now how to get them looſe again, thou knoweſt

Come, be not diſcouraged, Oh my ſoul. Let but thy attire of Grace be whole, that is, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, thy God, and ſo thy Saviour will accept thee. Though thy <hi>garments</hi> are not ſo much <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed with heaven,</hi> as thy brethrens are, but yet if they are but white and free from the ſpots of fleſh and ſpirit, thou wilt be looked on and liked of well enough. Thy Lord doth know that all have not talents alike; and where he gives but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, he expects but little. A Faith that is <hi>richly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered</hi> over with <hi>love</hi> and <hi>delight,</hi> is not given to all; and is not expected from any but from thoſe to whom it is given.

As yet I am now on earth, my toil and work lyes heavy on my hands, I have yet an afternoon to labour out, God knows my work is hard, too hard for me my ſelf to perform.

And canſt thou mourn! methinks if thou didſt love, thine heart ſhould rather ſympathize with his: He is ſinging, and ſhalt thou be ſighing? He is joying that his work is done, and now is welcoming into Heaven by God his Father, and ſhouting up by Angels voices, as the great Conquerour of the hearts of men on earth, and that now in triumph he is returned. And will a mournful weed, a wet eye, and a cloudy brow, become thee at theſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41194:72"/>times of Feſtivals? Shall the Heavenly Angels be joyful, and thou ſad? How ſtrangely will this be conſtrued! Will it not be ſaid, thou doſt not love him? or thou doſt envy his recovered glory that he had left, and now again hath taken? Or that thou canſt not endure to ſee him wear his Princes Crown in Heaven, that for a time he had laid aſide to come down to the earth to fetch thee thence to Heaven? But ah! my Lord, thou wilt not ſure interpret ſorrow thus; thou haſt not ſure forgot to give a meaning unto tears, to teach a ſigh to ſpeak, and then to know its language! Hath my Lord forgot ſo ſuddenly that he was on earth, and that he ſweat, and groan'd, and wept, and bled, as well as I do now? What though now all tears, and ſorrow, and ſighing is done away, and he cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to be any longer ſubject to our infirmities? yet ſure he knows it is not thus with us. I am not yet in Heaven, nor am I yet quite paſt the vale of ſorrow; and it cannot then be ſtrange to him, if he ſees ſometimes our faces look of a ſadder hue than thoſe that are in Heaven. But why ſhould thus my tears be check'd, and my throbbing heart be chidden? were it for a thing of nought I might be counted fool or child; but ſhall my Saviour die, and vent his ſoul in a ſtream of blood, and all in love to me? and ſhall he thus forſake the world, and die, and then be laid in the grave, and I be denied the liberty of following him thither as a mourner? Shall it be ſaid of the Prince of glory, that he died and had the burial of an aſs? becauſe there was none to ſorrow forth thoſe words of, <hi>Ah my Lord!</hi> What! ſhall it be granted to a Wife
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41194:73"/>to mourn for the death of a beloved Husband? and to a Child at the burial of a beloved Father? Shall not ſuch be blamed, but rather pitied? And ſhall their friends come in and confeſs the loſs and the ground of their ſorrow juſt, and rather ſit them down and bear them company in their grief? And muſt I of all be thus cenſur'd? Away with an Husband, Wife, or Child to me: Is he not more to me than ten Husbands? Might I not have had an hundred that would have never done half ſo much for me as he hath done? That firſt left his glory for my ſake, and then laid down his life, and took the ſtroke upon himſelf that I my ſelf deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and all becauſe he lov'd me? Was ever friend like this friend! and ever love, like this love! Many waters cannot quench love; but neither waters, blood, death, nor many deaths could quench his love to me. But ſhall he love, and die in love, and thus be forc'd to leave me, becauſe he lov'd me, and I not mourn the abſence of my beſt Beloved? How unreaſonably may any this deny me! But ah! what a bitter-worded check did I even now receive; as if my ſorrow would ariſe from the envying of his now glorious ſtate, and not from any love I bear him? Oh! what needle-pointed words are thoſe! methinks they have pierc'd mine heart in every part, and from each prick hath ſtarted forth a drop, that hath ſet it o're with a bloody dew! But how can it once be thought that envy ſhould get a room in an heart that's full of love, with which it ſwells, it bubbles up, and runs all over? it cannot be. Bear witneſs heavens! I do not grieve that you contain him,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41194:73"/>but that I on earth have loſt him! Oh my God! I am not ſorry that thy Son hath paſt his ſufferings, and is arriv'd to reſt, and got again into thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, his ancient neſt of love and pleaſure. Oh you bleſſed Orders of <hi>Seraphims</hi> and <hi>Cherubims,</hi> and you <hi>innumerable company of the ſpirits of the juſt men made perfect!</hi> I do not envy that you have my Lord with you, that you ſee his face, and live and walk, and joy in the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: Alas! we your poor Brethren could not make him ſo welcome here on earth, as you can there: we lov'd him as ſincerely as you, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd in him, and took delight too in him; but yet nothing near ſo much as you. You know him better than we do; for you know him as you are known, and therefore know better how to prize him. We know him but in <hi>part,</hi> and the value, price, and love could but be in the like proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He is therefore far much better there than here; and how ſhall I then either envy him or you! And what, my ſoul! ſhould I wiſh him back again? what if I thought I could prize and love him more, and could promiſe the like for all his beloved diſciples? I could not alike engage for the wicked, envious, malicious, unbelieving world; I could not promiſe he ſhould meet with no other <hi>Herod</hi> to ſeek his life, or that the hard-hearted <hi>Jews</hi> would give him better entertainment, whom they dare yet curſe with the name of Conjurer, though <hi>Moſes</hi> and their Prophets bore witneſs to him, and though they received a ſeal from Heaven in voices, thunders, ſigns, and an innumerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of real Miracles. Oh no! my Lord! though
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41194:74"/>I could wiſh to fee thy face again on earth, yet not in ſuch a ſtate of miſery in the midſt of a den of Bears and Lions, as not long ſince thou waſt. Ah! thou knoweſt I took no delight to hear that traiterous news of thine own <hi>Apoſtle</hi> that had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd thee; and that it fill'd mine heart with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh to hear how ſhamefully and ſcornfully thou waſt abuſed. Thou ſaweſt me bluſh when I heard thy face was ſpit on; my head did ake when thine was crowned with thorns. Anguiſh and indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did looſe my nerves, and with a palſie ſhook mine hands, when thine had a mock-Scepter put into them, a reed, and a ſcoff, <hi>Hail Jeſus King of the Jews.</hi> And did not mine heart break and bleed to hear that thine was pierced! Ah my Lord! and ſhall I yet find an heart to wiſh thee here again! No, no, I am glad thou haſt eſcap'd their bloody hands, and now got quite without their reach. I am glad thou haſt got to perfect eaſe and reſt; and know'ſt no pains, nor griefs, nor ſorrows. Oh! take a full poſſeſſion of thy Fathers breaſt, and ſit thee down upon his Throne, <hi>Thou art a King for ever.</hi> And take delight in theſe thy ſoul-did travel, die and bleed for on earth. I will repine at nothing that ſhall advance thy glory. But Oh! thou cruel bloody unbelieving world! you wicked murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bloody <hi>Jews!</hi> though I rejoice my Lord is ſafe arrived home, and quietly landed within his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; yet from you I cannot hold mine anger, that made his Sea a Sea of blood, and drain'd his heart to make it deep, and fill'd his ſails with ſighs and groans, that caus'd his voyage to be ſo doleful. What good got you to ſtand and laugh to ſee him
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41194:74"/>ſorrowful? to ſcoff and jeer to hear his lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations? what curſed rage was that to make ſuch haſt to fetch him vinegar and gall to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long his life, to lengthen out his dolors? How could you find ſuch barbarous hearts to triumph over a bleeding dying lamb, that was ſo innocent? How could you taunt at him when you heard him praying for you, <hi>Father forgive them!</hi> and ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly excuſing you, for <hi>they know not what they do!</hi> Methinks that kindly harmleſs carriage ſhould have pierced your hearts; thoſe melting words ſhould have diſſolv'd them; and inſtead of piercing him, I ſhould have thought you pierced. And ah! but that I know an unbelieving heart my ſelf, and underſtand what hardneſs means, I ſhould ſtand and wonder! Oh! it's too hard an Adamant for downy words, and doleful ſounds, and tender carriages to break and ſhatter! How often have I outſtood all thoſe my ſelf! And when I ſerved my fleſh, how little did I mind them! And when they have been preſented to me in the Goſpel, or in a Sermon told that all theſe tortures he endur'd for me, and I in part believed it too, yet was I not as a man bereft of my ſenſes, and I was no more mov'd in mine heart, as if I had not heard or underſtood, and were quite bereav'd of ſenſe and reaſon. But had I thus continued in my ſenſeleſs unbelieving ſtate, and as I liv'd ſo died; yet how deſervedly ſhould I have born the wrath of God, and have been ſent to Hell as a recompence of mine unbelief? And yet, you careleſs ſecure <hi>Jews,</hi> can you think to eſcape when God comes to make inquiſition for blood? How will you do if this ſin ſhall find you
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41194:75"/>out? If God requires blood for blood, what will become of yours? If he had been no more than a common man, the Law would then have required your lives for payment. But how if in the end he prove a <hi>Prophet?</hi> nay more than that, the Son of the moſt high God, the Prince and Saviour whom God had promiſed to raiſe, the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> whom <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets bare witneſs to, and him that you ſo long long'd and wiſht to ſee! How will you look! what will you ſay! what anſwer will you make when all theſe truths are cleared? where will you hide your ſelves for ſhame? and what will you do when confuſion ſhall thus take hold upon you? What! will you then confeſs the fact, or will you deny it? with what face can you do the firſt? And if you do the latter, the curſe you and your Fathers drew upon your ſelves, <hi>Let his blood be upon us and our children!</hi> ſtands ſtill on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord againſt you, and will cry you guilty. Will you excuſe it with your unbelieving ignorance? But how will you be able to rub your brows into ſo much confidence? How dare you ſay you were ignorant of him, when you ſay you knew both <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and they bare witneſs of him? You askt a ſign, and did he not give you both ſigns and wonders? How often did he cure your Lame? How wonderfully did he heal your Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and thoſe ſick of the Palſie, yea of all manner of diſeaſes? How did he open the eyes of the blind, and give light to him that was born blind! yea, reſtore the withered hand, and make the crooked ſtraight, and open the ears of the deaf, and caſt out Devils, and raiſe the dead! <hi>Therefore
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41194:75"/>let all the houſe of Iſrael know aſſuredly, that God hath made that Son Jeſus whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>Upon which Text, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.36. the Author Mr. <hi>Tho. Wadſworth</hi> preach'd at <hi>Gregories</hi> Church by <hi>Pauls, March</hi> 29, 1656. evidencing clearly from thoſe words:</p>
               <p n="1">(1) That the poor life and ignominious death of him that was crucified at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was no good argument why the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould reject him from being the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) That that very God-man named <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> that was crucified at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> was the <hi>true Meſſiah</hi> whom God made and appointed to be Saviour to the World.</p>
               <p>If his Notes were ſufficiently legible, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and improving of theſe two Propoſitions, ſo that they might have been publiſht (as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, unleſs any took them in ſhort-hand for his own uſe) there would have been found in that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe a notable antidote againſt the poyſons of <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Atheiſm</hi> of this preſent age.</p>

                     <salute>Dear Siſter!</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YOU may remember very well that I ſent a Letter to you all in general, to wit, my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and other Siſters; but it is my wonder and grief that I ſhould receive an anſwer from none of you! I thought that your loves to me were not ſo contracted, but that I might have procured ſuch a favour at your hands as three or four lines in a Letter; but however your not regarding of me, hath not begotten in my ſoul ſuch regardleſneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, and therefore from among the reſt I have choſen <hi>you</hi> out in particular to ſee whether you in particular will give me an anſwer to my other Letter. I remember that the laſt time I was with you, upon Conference that I had with you, I found a good and pliable nature in you; ſome ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart appear'd by that cryſtal dew which trickled down your cheeks: I would have wiſht in ſome reſpects that it had continued until this time. For truly nothing ſpeaks fairer weather in Heaven than moiſtned cheeks below on earth; you muſt not think to come to <hi>Mount Zion,</hi> the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41194:76"/>Jeruſalem,</hi> before you have paſt thorow a vail of tears. Heaven is not a bauble, and it can't be attain'd by mirth and jollity; you muſt not think to live merrily in Earth and in Heaven too. I know you are naturally merry and jocond, but you muſt labour to mortifie that merry nature you have; you are naturally full of talk, but if you love your <hi>ſoul</hi> you muſt labour to bridle the <hi>tongue.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you would ſay, <hi>O Brother!</hi> this I would will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly do, but I cannot tell how. I will give you this <hi>anſwer:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Labour to live more ſeriouſly, to talk leſs; let your thoughts be on God, and think that he hears every word you ſpeak; and as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſays, <hi>You muſt give an account for every idle word.</hi> You muſt not think you ſhall ever be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in love, that you ſhall ever bathe your ſelf in Divine raviſhments to all eternity with God in glory, and walk ſo lightly and vainly here on earth. O that I could but perſwade your ſoul of this! If I could, I know that you would deſire no other glory, than to ſwim all your life-time in a river of tears. I ſhall not here ſpeak of the glory which your ſoul ſhould enjoy in Heaven, leſt my ſoul in writing ſhould be ſwallow'd up with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion! for if I knew where to begin, yet I ſhould never know where to make an end. Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have been wading theſe five thouſand years in this Ocean, and cannot come to the depth of it; yea, and ſhall be wading to all eternity with the glorified Saints, and yet ſhall never fathom it. And now if thou art willing that thy ſoul ſhould accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany my ſoul unto this Ocean of Love, take notice
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41194:77"/>then of theſe paths which I ſhall here ſet down, which will lead thee unto this deſir'd happineſs. And truly I beg of thee, and likewiſe charge thee, in the preſence of the Almighty God, as thou ſhalt one day anſwer it at the Judgment-ſeat, when God ſhall judg the quick and the dead, that you do not, when you have read this Letter, caſt it away, and look on it no more. Therefore I beſeech of thee, as thou art dear to me as a Siſter, that thou wouldſt put into practiſe every word that I ſhall ſay.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, <hi>Be conſtant in prayer by thy ſelf both evening and morning;</hi> and if you find any good motion in the day-time, go then again to prayer. And if you ask me, How you ſhould pray? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thee, pray againſt every ſin thou find'ſt thy heart prone to commit. Pray againſt thy carnal joy, and beg that thou maiſt be moſt ſerious in thy converſation. Doſt thou find in thy ſoul that thou canſt not mourn for ſin? Pray that God would ſoften thy hard heart, that he would make thee to mourn, to weep and lament thy ſins, becauſe they are againſt ſuch a tender and loving Father as God. Doſt thou find that thou art given to anger, pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſs and frowardneſs; pray earneſtly, beg of God on thy knees, as if thou wert pleading for thy life, that God would humble thee, and give thee more love to himſelf, and to the reſt of thy brethren; and take heed likewiſe of angering them. O that thou wouldſt but practiſe this! truly, truly, I ſhould rejoice, Angels in Heaven would rejoice; as it is written, <hi>The Angels re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joise at the converſion of a ſinner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:41194:77"/>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Look that thou readeſt the Scriptures diligently every day;</hi> and let this be thy <hi>firſt</hi> work in the morning, and the <hi>laſt</hi> at night. And if thou canſt not underſtand, go to God, and beg that he would give thee more light; and if thou doſt this likewiſe, happy ſhalt thou be. And ſeeing it is late before you go to ſupper and bed, therefore thou maiſt ſet apart ſome time for this duty in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon. And this you muſt do, and then wait upon God for a bleſſing. And truly do but reflect on your ſelf, and tell me what's the cauſe of all that groſs ignorance which is in you? Truly 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you read little in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and other good Books. And if perhaps you read a Chapter now and then, it is either becauſe you are forc'd to it, or becauſe you would read ſome ſtory in the Old Teſtament, only to recreate your carnal mind. Let me but ask you this <hi>one queſtion,</hi> Do you, when you take the Bible in your hand, conſider it is the <hi>book of God,</hi> and if you do not practiſe what you read, it will turn to your condemnation? Do but conſider this thing ſeriouſly, and the God of Heaven bleſs it to your ſoul. Now I pray and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you not to ſlight this which I have ſaid, but turn it into practiſe. And it will be my deſire th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t you will <hi>write this out fair,</hi> that thou maiſt read it ſometimes, and maiſt know that thy brother loves <hi>thy ſoul</hi> as dearly as his own. What I have now writ unto thee in particular, thou wilt do well if thou communicateſt it to all thy brethren, that they may not be wanting in theſe things which I have here deſired of thee in particular; for I could deſire that thou mighteſt begin to lead the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41194:78"/>way to Heaven in that family; but eſpecially let this be known to my Siſter <hi>Anne;</hi> I pray her not to think much that I direct this to you, and not to her, for I thought you would write to me, and I queſtioned whether ſhe hath not forgot; but if ſhe doth write, I aſſure her, if my ſoul and body can do her ſervice, it ſhall.

God is my witneſs that I daily make mention of you in my <hi>prayers;</hi> and I aſſure you it will exceedingly raiſe my heart in <hi>praiſes</hi> if God will but anſwer them upon your ſoul. And truly my expectations are very great towards you and the reſt of my friends. I know not who they ſhall be, either in that family, or ſome where elſe, but rather there; for God of late hath ſhewn me much of his goodneſs <hi>as to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering of my prayers as to particular perſons.</hi> And I am aſſured that he hath ſeveral times drawn out my heart as much, if not more for that family. So that I live in continual expectations of hearing of the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs</hi> to riſe among you, and the day ſtar of holineſs and purity to break out of ſome of your ſouls. And to this purpoſe I have ſent you this Letter, that <hi>you</hi> among the reſt might be one that may fulfil my joy in the Lord. I am ſorry that all this while I have not heard from my Brother <hi>John;</hi> I hope that the Lord will ſtir up his heart likewiſe Heaven-ward. Tell him that I would have writ to him, but that I had ſo much to write to others, ſo that I was fain to ſteal a little time to write theſe few lines.

                  <p>AS the Letter was with great affection <hi>deſired,</hi> ſo was it as gratefully <hi>received</hi> by me.

               <p>IN theſe words you have a deſcription of the Church of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> on earth; the Church of Chriſt is of all Societies of the world the moſt glorious; it is a Society <hi>founded</hi> by the Counſel of the great God; a Society that is <hi>purchaſed</hi> and bought by the blood of the Son of God; 'tis a Society <hi>called</hi> out of this wicked world to worſhip God in ſpirit and in truth; 'tis a Society that is to God himſelf as the <hi>apple of his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41194:80"/>eye;</hi> 'tis a Society that ſhall keep the Angels of Heaven company to all eternity in the Heavens, to glorifie the Maker and the Redeemer of the world. This is the Church; a Church in a Kingdom is the <hi>glory</hi> of the Kingdom; and <hi>God</hi> in the Church is the glory of the Church. When God leaveth a Church or Kingdom, you may name it this name, <hi>the glory is departed;</hi> the glory is departed from a Town or Kingdom, when the Church of Chriſt is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
               <p>If it be ſo, it will be worth our while to inquire which is this Church of Chriſt; for there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pretenſions laid to the <hi>Church,</hi> many would <hi>call</hi> themſelves the Church; the <hi>Jews</hi> they would be the Church of God; the <hi>Turks</hi> would be a Church of God, for they profeſs to worſhip the God of Heaven; the <hi>Papiſts</hi> they would be a Church of God; and in <hi>England</hi> there are many parties laying their claims to the Church of God. No wonder, my brethren! that every one is ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to bear that title of being the Church of God; 'tis the moſt glorious title of the world, as I have ſhewn you, 'tis the <hi>glory</hi> of the world.</p>
               <p>But to help you to find out this Church in the midſt of all theſe claims that are laid to it, I have choſen this <hi>verſe,</hi> wherein the Holy Ghoſt giveth a <hi>deſcription</hi> of it, for by theſe characters you will be able to find it out, for this <hi>verſe</hi> is nothing elſe but a <hi>characterizing of the nature</hi> of the Church of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And there appeared a great wonder in Heaven, a Woman clothed with the Sun, and the Moon under her feet, and upon her head a Crown of twelve Stars.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:41194:81"/>
               <p>The Church is deſcribed <hi>two</hi> ways:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>In General.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>More Particularly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt in general, <hi>There appeared a great wonder in Heaven;</hi> that is, in this Viſion of <hi>John</hi> he did ſeem to ſee a very ſtrange and unuſual ſight; we call things <hi>wonders</hi> that are ſtrange things; it is <hi>no wonder</hi> to ſee the Sun ſhining, becauſe it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; and the Stars to give light, becauſe common; but when we ſee a <hi>Blazing-ſtar,</hi> we call it a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; ſo the meaning is, <hi>I ſaw a great wonder,</hi> ſaith <hi>John;</hi> and what of that? I ſaw a <hi>Woman,</hi> I ſaw a <hi>Woman in the Heavens.</hi> It is common to ſee the Sun and Moon and Stars there, but to ſee a <hi>Woman</hi> is a wonder; and ſo the Church is a wonder; to ſee a fire keep alive in the midſt of the Sea; to ſee a people keeping themſelves <hi>holy</hi> in the midſt of a wicked and perverſe generation; to ſee a people live to the <hi>glory</hi> of God in a wicked and debaucht Kingdom, is a <hi>wonder!</hi> for in ſpite of all the wrath and rage of the <hi>Devil</hi> they are reſolved to love God, and follow the Lamb where ever he leads them, this is a <hi>wonder;</hi> and in many reſpects the Church may be ſaid to be a <hi>wonder,</hi> a wonder to <hi>Angels,</hi> a wonder to <hi>Devils,</hi> and a wonder to the <hi>wicked</hi> world.</p>
               <p>A wonder to <hi>Angels,</hi> we read they deſire to peep into the myſtery of Redemption, of Chriſts coming into the world to die for a company of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful creatures that deſerve no better a condition than the dungeon of Hell; but for you Angels to ſee God taking poor ſinners from the dungeon of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41194:81"/>ſin and wrath, and raiſing them upon Thrones by giving them repentance and faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and adopting them Sons and Daughters, and taking them to be his friends; this the Angels wonder at.</p>
               <p>And why may I not gueſs, a wonder to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils? for them to ſee the <hi>Son of God</hi> come, and themſelves to be paſt by, to be forſaken, eternally reſerved in chains, and to ſee ſuch creatures as we are to be brought into a ſtate of fellowſhip and communion with God, may make them ſtand and wonder. And truly how can it chuſe but be a <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> to our ſelves: if <hi>David</hi> in ſeeing the Heaven, Sun, Moon, and Stars, could cry out, <hi>Lord, what is man that thou art mindful of him?</hi> How can we chuſe but wonder when we look upon our ſelves, being guilty of all manner of ſins either in heart or life, to ſee God take us and waſh us like ſwine out of the mire, and cleanſe us, and make us live like his children, and call us his own, and write his name upon us, and ſeal us up for an eternal ſtate in the Heavens?</p>
               <p>And ſo the wicked world do wonder that we do not follow them in the ſame exceſs of riot, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, and ſinging, and ranting in the Taverns and Alehouſes, they <hi>wonder</hi> at it.</p>
               <p>Well, I ſaw this <hi>wonder in Heaven,</hi> that is in a moſt <hi>exalted ſtate,</hi> and ſo my Brethren, it is in its own ſelf, in its nature, it is highly exalted in the heavens of Gods favour and affections; and when the time ſhall come that God will perfect his Church, ſhe ſhall ſhine in glory as in a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted ſtate and condition, and it is this ſhe expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41194:82"/>and for this ſhe ſaith, <hi>Come, Lord Jeſus;</hi> and for this he ſaith, <hi>I come quickly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But more particularly to the <hi>nature</hi> of this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>What is it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is deſcribed by a <hi>Woman.</hi> 2. The <hi>Attire.</hi> And 3. the <hi>place</hi> of her ſtanding.</p>
               <p>Firſt, A <hi>Woman,</hi> and her <hi>attire,</hi> and that is firſt of her head, <hi>a Crown of twelve Stars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The attire of her body, <hi>clothed with the Sun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then 3dly, Here is her ſtanding, <hi>She ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the Moon,</hi> trampleth that under her feet; and this is a deſcription of <hi>you,</hi> ſo many of you as are true members of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; what great things are here ſpoken, are ſpoken of every believer here.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a <hi>Woman:</hi> why is the Church compared to a <hi>Woman?</hi> that the Church is compared to a <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> in Scripture, that is plain; the Book of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi> which is <hi>Solomons Song,</hi> is a Song of the Church repreſented as a <hi>Spouſe</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt: the <hi>Prophets</hi> frequently compar'd the Church to a <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> in the Old Teſtament, and God is her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> compared it to a <hi>Woman. I have endeavoured as a Virgin to preſent you to God without ſpot.</hi> And the Church is called the <hi>Lambs Wife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for what reaſon does the Holy Ghoſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Church to a <hi>Woman?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For theſe four <hi>Reaſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. For her <hi>Beauty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:41194:82"/>2. For her <hi>Affection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. For her <hi>Fruitfulneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. For her <hi>Weakneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For theſe four ſhe may well be compared to a <hi>Woman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>For her Beauty.</hi> I ſpeak not of that <hi>outward,</hi> that skin-deep beauty which a little time will bring to wrinkles; but I ſpeak of an <hi>inward</hi> beauty, a ſoul beauty; the Church of Chriſt is beautiful, that is ſoul-beautiful; the Graces of the Saints up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſoul of the Saints is the red and white; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing enamours Chriſt ſo much as your <hi>faith</hi> in his Promiſes, <hi>love</hi> to his Glory, <hi>patience</hi> in afflictions, <hi>obedience</hi> to his Commandments. <hi>Thou art fair, my beloved,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to his Spouſe. The Church is compar'd to a Woman for her beauty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I have endeavoured to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you as a Virgin:</hi> how? not a deformed one, but a Virgin without wrinkle, without ſpot; when the Church is ſanctified by the Spirit of Chriſt, and nothing in your hearts but love, fear, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then you have this <hi>beauty</hi> that is without ſpot or wrinkle; ſin does ſully the ſoul, but grace taketh away ſpots and wrinkles. Likewiſe,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Church is compared to a <hi>Woman</hi> for her <hi>affection;</hi> their affections ordinarily are more ſtrong. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> his love did exceed the love of women. The Holy Ghoſt compareth the Church to a <hi>Woman,</hi> to ſignifie that all the members of Chriſt have a very ardent love and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to Chriſt. No love ſo ſtrong as the love of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41194:83"/>a Saint to Chriſt; and therefore 'tis ſaid, <hi>That many waters cannot quench it.</hi> There are few will be beggered for the ſake of another, or baniſhed or hanged upon a Gallows for the ſake of another, burnt at a ſtake for anothers ſake; and yet the love of a Saint maketh nothing of all this; it rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to ſee its goods ſpoil'd for Chriſt, to think it ſelf worthy to be whipt for Chriſt, to go up a ladder, and to be thrown down with a rope about its neck for Chriſt. Water cannot quench a Saints love, neither can fire hinder a Saint from Chriſt; neither things preſent, or things to come can ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from Chriſt. You would all be of this Church, pray look that you have <hi>affections</hi> ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Chriſt. You may have a time to try your <hi>affections;</hi> if you <hi>want affections,</hi> you are none of this <hi>Woman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Church is compared to a <hi>Woman</hi> for her <hi>fruitfulneſs;</hi> the Church of Chriſt is a <hi>fruitful</hi> Church; that is, the ſociety of the Lord Jeſus do bring forth daily children to God, and as like the Father as they can look. The Church does meet together to preach the Goſpel, and to pray and praiſe God together, and God does ſo bleſs them with the Ordinances, that they do convert ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners unto God, they bring ſouls that were aliens in their mind, they bring them to acquaintance with God. The Church is always travelling and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, and God does bleſs her to bring Sons and Daughters to himſelf; and when they are born they are like Chriſt, patient as Chriſt was patient, meek as he was meek, humble as he was humble, and heavenly as he was heavenly. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41194:83"/>pretend to be a Son or Daughter of this <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and do not bear the Image of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, they are baſtards. Barrenneſs under the Law 'twas counted a very great curſe. So take this note to find out the Church of Chriſt upon earth, and in <hi>England,</hi> look upon the ſeveral ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties profeſſing the name of Chriſt, ſee which look the moſt like him; have they affections to Chriſt? is there a beauty in their lives? are they barren? do they convert ſinners to them? Some cry with a loud voice, <hi>The Temple of the Lord are we;</hi> but I pray ſee if they are <hi>fruitful.</hi> Are they travelling and bringing forth? and have they Sons and Daughters brought forth daily to them? or little converſion among them, they are not fruitful, they have not Sons and Daughters born to Jeſus Chriſt? and by that you may know where to find Chriſts Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The Church is compared to a <hi>Woman,</hi> becauſe of her <hi>weakneſs;</hi> the Woman is the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker ſex, ſhe is not made for fighting, but in caſe of danger for flying; for this is the nature of the Church; it is not of a domineering boiſterous ſpirit, but a womanly ſpirit, modeſt, humble and meek. Where you ſee a people pretend to be this <hi>Woman,</hi> pouring out malice and wrath, a domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering people, are they like this <hi>Woman</hi> that fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in time of danger, but not from Chriſt? <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>And there appeared another great wonder in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, behold a great red Dragon,</hi> and that's the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; <hi>and the Dragon ſtood before the woman to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour her child as ſoon as it was born.</hi> But what was the end? did ſhe fight? no, there were Angels
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41194:84"/>ſtood to contend for her, ſhe took up no arms, thought not upon fighting; but preſently the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel reſcued her, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. <hi>And there was war in Heaven, Michael and his Angels fought againſt the Dragon: and the Dragon and his Angels fought, and prevailed not.</hi> That is, the hoſt of Angels did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with the Devil and his Angels, and would not permit him to deſtroy her, and ſhe fled into the Wilderneſs, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>And ſhe fled into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, where ſhe hath a place prepared of God, that they ſhould feed her there a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore days.</hi> She fled into a Wilderneſs, but in a ſecure ſtate; ſhe was ſecur'd in her Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and God lookt after her; and we are in this <hi>thouſand two hundred threeſcore days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She is a <hi>weak</hi> Church, but ſtrong in Chriſt; and if ſo, my brethren, though you be weak, and meek as a ſheep, and compared to a <hi>Woman</hi> the <hi>weaker</hi> ſex, yet notwithſtanding fear not; for I cannot ſtand to ſpeak of all the things in this Chapter. <hi>Great wings were given her to fly with; the whole earth ſtept out to help her, and ſwallowed up the flood which the Dragon caſt out of his mouth: and the Angels helped her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well now, let us come to the <hi>attire;</hi> I have ſhewn you the reaſons why ſhe is compared to a <hi>Woman,</hi> and we will begin at her <hi>head,</hi> and ſo come down to her <hi>foot: On her head a Crown of twelve S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>, and her body was clothed with the Sun, and under her foot the Moon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What was this <hi>Crown of twelve Stars?</hi> if you do
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41194:84"/>but mark the H. Ghoſt through this book of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,</hi> you will find him take a great deal of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in this number <hi>twelve;</hi> and he does always uſe it, when he ſpeaketh of the true Church; the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it had twelve Gates; and the Tree of life in the midſt of this new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> this Tree of Life bore <hi>twelve</hi> ſorts of fruits, this you have in the laſt Chapter. <hi>And in the midſt of the ſtreets of it, and of either ſide of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month, and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the Nations.</hi> Why <hi>twelve Gates</hi> for the City, and <hi>twelve fruits</hi> upon the tree, and <hi>twelve Stars</hi> upon the Crown of this Church? what is the meaning of this? I will tell you what it is: You know <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> when he went about to gather this Church out of the world, he did chuſe <hi>twelve men</hi> that were his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and theſe <hi>twelve men</hi> he did acquaint with the whole myſtery of the Goſpel; all the things that he would have them teach the world, he gave them in command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and they were to be under him, the Fathers to beget this Church. And Chriſt calleth them lights, <hi>Ye are the lights of the world,</hi> becauſe they were to deliver forth this Doctrine of the Goſpel, this light from Heaven, theſe truths that lead men like tapers through this dark Dungeon to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of God; they were to be the <hi>lights</hi> to them. Now theſe <hi>twelve Stars</hi> are the <hi>twelve Apoſtles.</hi> And <hi>ſhe had a Crown of twelve Stars;</hi> that is, ſhe was a <hi>Woman</hi> that profeſſed faith in the Doctrine of the <hi>twelve Apostles;</hi> ſhe owned thoſe truths that the Apoſtles preached, and would receive no truths as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41194:85"/>matters of her <hi>faith</hi> but what the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did teach; and by this ſhe was to be known in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Generations of the World, ſo that by this character of a Woman with a Crown of <hi>twelve Stars,</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> hath given you a note by which you may find out this Church, thoſe ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that <hi>believe</hi> what they taught, and <hi>worſhip</hi> God according to what worſhip they delivered, that is the <hi>woman with a crown of twelve Stars;</hi> but if you ſee any ſociety of Chriſtians, and you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ind more Stars thanS <hi>twelve,</hi> a ſtar of vain Philoſophy, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane tradition, or a ſtar of rudiments of the world, look upon them as none of the <hi>ſtars</hi> that Chriſt hath put in the <hi>Womans crown;</hi> therefore when Chriſt commiſſioned the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, he gave not liberty to <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> or any of the <hi>twelve</hi> to lay any Commandment upon his Church but what they had from his mouth in the laſt of <hi>Matthew;</hi> and indeed they are as it were the laſt words he ſpake to them: <hi>verſ.</hi> 19, 20. <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Well, what ſhall we teach? <hi>teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you.</hi> No more; no more let them believe than what I have; delivered to you; let them uſe ſuch Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in Worſhip as I have appointed you, and no more; they were not to <hi>exceed</hi> there commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it was as dangerous for them to do it, as any Ambaſſador to exceed the commiſſion of his Prince; and therefore the Apoſtles when they were brought before the Rulers and Governours, and they charged them to <hi>teach no more in the name
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41194:85"/>of this Jeſus,</hi> ſay, <hi>We cannot but ſpeak the things which we have ſeen and heard;</hi> how can we chuſe but teach the things which we have ſeen Chriſt do? and reveal the miracles that we ſee wrought? and how can we chuſe but preach the Doctrine that we received from his mouth? They did not ſay, how can we chuſe but do that which we have ſeen invented by others; no, if they had taught any thing elſe, Chriſt would not have born them out; and therefore in the Election of a new <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> in <hi>Judas</hi> his ſtead, they made choice of one to bear witneſs of what <hi>Chriſt had ſaid and done;</hi> and all the Churches of Chriſt from that time, they are to keep cloſe to thoſe Doctrines, the Doctrines of the <hi>twelve Apoſtles;</hi> and by this they ſhall be known to be the Woman if they ſtill keep the Crown that hath but <hi>twelve Stars.</hi> And now you may know what to think of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and what to think of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Some have not the <hi>twelve Stars,</hi> others have; as the <hi>Pope hath them,</hi> but he hath added; others have the <hi>ſtars of humane tradition</hi> of the <hi>rudiments of the world.</hi> I give you but the <hi>general note;</hi> for I will only give you <hi>rules</hi> in finding out the Church, and when you have found it, keep cloſe to her; if you would find the Church, ask what Doctrine ſhe holds, and whether there be any thing added, not one <hi>ſtar added,</hi> but keep cloſe to the Crown that hath <hi>juſt twelve ſtars</hi> in it.</p>
               <p>Now let us come downward: <hi>And ſhe was clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the Sun:</hi> and you ſee the Holy Ghoſt hath picked out the moſt glorious thing in all the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41194:86"/>Heavens to reſemble the <hi>beauty,</hi> and <hi>lovelineſs,</hi> and <hi>majeſty</hi> of the Church; there was not any thing in the world to reſemble the luſter, and majeſty, and beauty of this Church; and therefore he goes up to Heaven, and putteth a Crown of Stars upon her head, and clotheth her with <hi>Sun beams; and ſhe was clothed with the Sun;</hi> what muſt this Sun be? why in the Heavens, you know, the Sun is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of lights, and its influences are moſt marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and there is but one Sun. Why, what is there in the Kingdom of God that the <hi>Sun</hi> is moſt likely to ſhadow forth? I <hi>anſwer,</hi> it muſt be the <hi>Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt;</hi> and he is compared to the Sun in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as in <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2. <hi>But unto you that fear my name ſhall the Sun of righteouſneſs ariſe with heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his wings;</hi> that is, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> ſhall ariſe with healing in his wings, the wings of the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams. Chriſt is here compared to the <hi>Sun;</hi> well, but how may this Sun be ſaid to be a <hi>clothing?</hi> is there any ground for it? why yes, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> does uſe an expreſſion wherein he holdeth Chriſt as the <hi>Churches clothing;</hi> and ſo put the compariſon that one compareth Chriſt to the <hi>Sun,</hi> and the other where you find Chriſt compared to the <hi>clothing of the Church,</hi> and then you have this truth, to wit, <hi>the Church is clothed with the Sun,</hi> i.e. with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Nom. 13.14. <hi>But put ye on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Here you ſee plainly the Apoſtle does compare Chriſt to a <hi>garment,</hi> and does exhort the Church to <hi>clothe themſelves with Chriſt;</hi> and though Chriſt does not call himſelf a <hi>garment,</hi> yet he does invite the Church to him, that he may clothe her, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18. <hi>I counſel thee to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41194:86"/>buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou maiſt be rich, and white raiment that thou maiſt be clothed, and that the ſhame of thy nakedneſs do not appear: and anoint thine eyes with eye-ſalve that thou maiſt ſee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, pray, ſay you, how may the Church be ſaid to be <hi>clothed with Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In two <hi>reſpects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In as much as they are clothed with the <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Juſtification,</hi> and this in and by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As they are <hi>clothed with the divine nature,</hi> with the nature of Chriſt, or with the <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sanctification;</hi> they that have theſe <hi>two righteouſneſſes</hi> upon them, they are clothed with Chriſt, they are clothed with the Sun.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When you have the <hi>righteouſneſs of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> for ſo this <hi>Woman</hi> had; the <hi>Church is a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified woman,</hi> a pardoned woman, and ſo are all the members of this Church; all her iniquities are all blotted out; all hand-writings of Ordinances are all cancelled, all nailed to the Croſs of Chriſt, all wrapped up and buried, and ſhall never riſe up in judgment againſt them; this is a <hi>clothing</hi> by which her nakedneſs is clothed; why, Oh thou poor creature, that lyeſt open to the wrath of God, to the ſtorms of his diſpleaſure; thou haſt no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don till Chriſt pardoneth thee; the Woman is clothed with the Sun, that is with the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Juſtification that Jeſus Chriſt hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for her. If you ſee a Church boaſting of a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of their own, a <hi>Phariſaical</hi> righteouſneſs, a <hi>Legal</hi> Righteouſneſs, a righteouſneſs of their
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41194:87"/>own, this is not the <hi>woman,</hi> for ſhe hath not the <hi>clothing;</hi> there is a people that ſay they are the Church, but look unto them and you ſhall ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> upon them, they are not clothed with the <hi>Sun,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have they the Crown of <hi>twelve ſtars;</hi> they do not build their faith upon the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> neither do they cover their nakedneſs with the <hi>Righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be <hi>not deceived.</hi> There are many parties cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we are the people; look to them, ſee if they keep cloſe to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> have the <hi>Crown of twelve ſtars;</hi> and again, ſee whether they have the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſinners; do they look upon all their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance that they hope to have with the Father, as from the Son? There is a generation that have ſome tokens of mortification upon them, but alas every one that looketh like the <hi>Woman</hi> is not the <hi>Woman;</hi> you muſt have all the attire upon her, if you will conclude her to be the <hi>Woman;</hi> never dare to join your ſelves to a people that are not clothed with the <hi>Righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> that died for poor ſinners, and made their peace upon the Croſs, having expiated their ſin thereby. This <hi>Righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> will grow more ſplendent, and more firm, the longer you wear it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There is a righteouſneſs of holineſs, of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;</hi> it is not enough that this Church is clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, but this Church is clothed with the <hi>nature of Chriſt,</hi> Chriſt is upon her, and Chriſt is <hi>within her;</hi> ſhe is all full
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41194:87"/>of Chriſt, all over clothed with Chriſt, <hi>clothed with his nature;</hi> and therefore you find the Lord Jeſus Chriſt calls you to an <hi>imitation</hi> of him, <hi>Learn of me for I am meek.</hi> This woman is no haſty woman, no wrathful, no revengeful woman; when ſhe is provoked, ſhe will not rail again, ſhe will <hi>pray</hi> for them that curſe her. And if you ſee a ſociety of people that live not in <hi>meekneſs,</hi> and <hi>holineſs,</hi> and do not follow the patterns of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that is not the ſociety which is the true Church; neither if you ſee a people boaſt of Chriſt dying for them, and yet wallow like ſwine in the mire, and defile them with the filth of ſin and luſt, that is not the <hi>woman,</hi> that is not the Church. And now you may, if you would ſee the Church, look upon the <hi>converſations</hi> of the Churches in <hi>England,</hi> look upon their <hi>lives,</hi> ſee how they live; if you ſee them a drunken, a curſing, a ſwearing Church, a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming Church, this is none of the <hi>Lambs wife,</hi> for the <hi>woman</hi> is clothed with the Sun, with the <hi>new nature of Chriſt,</hi> with the <hi>holy nature of Chriſt,</hi> hath <hi>put on Chriſt,</hi> and makes <hi>no proviſion</hi> for the fleſh, to fulfil the luſts thereof.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee the other part of her clothing, and <hi>ſhe is clothed with the Sun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt, and that is, <hi>The Moon under her feet;</hi> What is here meant by the <hi>Moon?</hi> We muſt here reſpect the <hi>Moon</hi> that ruleth by night. You ſee the clothing of the Church is ſet out by the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, he is called the <hi>Sun;</hi> now whatever is oppoſite to the <hi>Sun,</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt, that muſt be
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41194:88"/>here ſignified by the <hi>Moon;</hi> whatever is in this <hi>world,</hi> or in <hi>Churches,</hi> found oppoſite to Jeſus Chriſt, why that is the <hi>Moon</hi> that the Church trampleth <hi>under foot,</hi> and will have nothing to do with; for as the Sun is the Prince of Light, and ruleth the day, ſo the <hi>Moon</hi> is the <hi>Queen of the Night;</hi> and by this <hi>Moon</hi> is repreſented all the works of darkneſs, of the Kingdom of <hi>darkneſs,</hi> which are oppoſite to the Kingdom of <hi>light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this Church that weareth a <hi>Crown of twelve ſtars upon her head, and is clothed with the Sun,</hi> it is always <hi>day</hi> with her, they walk not in darkneſs, they are not the children of the night.</p>
               <p>Well then, what are theſe things of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of darkneſs? why,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There are the heads of the Kingdom of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and thoſe are the <hi>Devils;</hi> the <hi>Moon</hi> ſignifieth the <hi>night,</hi> and the night ſignifieth the Kingdom of <hi>darkneſs;</hi> the <hi>Devils</hi> are the Moon that are under the Churches feet: Oh! in what ſtate does the Church ſit clothed with the Sun, and all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Hell under her feet! ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Go preach, and I give you power over all Devils; and they came back again, and ſaid, Lord, we have healed diſeaſes, and the very Devils are ſubject to us.</hi> That is, the <hi>Devils</hi> lye trampled under foot of the Church. Satan ſhall be laid at your feet <hi>ſhortly;</hi> and what an honour is it? You think it much to conquer men, why here is a poor <hi>woman</hi> that conquers the <hi>powers of darkneſs;</hi> not in your own ſtrength, but in the ſtrength of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to whom you are <hi>married,</hi> whoſe righteouſneſs you wear.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:41194:88"/>2. <hi>All the inſtruments of the Devil are under you;</hi> who are they? they are all thoſe that take part with the <hi>Devil</hi> in the world; how ſhall we find them out? why, you may find them out thus: They are always <hi>night-walkers; Moon walkers</hi> hate the light; they are wicked and ungodly men, that live after their luſts, who pleaſe the fleſh, and are enemies to God, and to his people; theſe are the <hi>inſtruments</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> theſe are they that are meant by the <hi>Moon,</hi> and the <hi>Woman</hi> ſetteth her <hi>foot</hi> upon them. And this does ſignifie, that <hi>all wicked</hi> men that are mocking and deriding her, and clap their hands when they ſee her fly, and ſay, Thus we would have it; ſhall fall under her feet in the iſſue. Know you <hi>fooliſh ſinners,</hi> the time is coming when you ſhall lie at <hi>her foot,</hi> and ſhe ſhall trample upon you; and that is another thing, the <hi>Devils,</hi> are the <hi>Principalities and powers</hi> of night, and wicked men are the Angels of theſe Princes, whom Chriſt made ſpoil of openly.</p>
               <p>But again, all <hi>principles, hereſies, falſe doctrines,</hi> contrary to the <hi>nature</hi> of God, the Trinity, the <hi>union of the two natures,</hi> God and man; the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Justification by faith only;</hi> all thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that are raiſed by the <hi>Devil</hi> in the world that are <hi>contrary</hi> to the Doctrine of Chriſt, are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the <hi>night,</hi> and the <hi>woman</hi> ſhe treadeth down all <hi>falſe</hi> Doctrines.</p>
               <p>Again, all <hi>falſe apprehenſions, institutions</hi> and <hi>appointments</hi> concerning the <hi>worſhip</hi> of God, are all the effects of ignorance, born of the <hi>night;</hi> all <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition</hi> that is introduced into the world, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, thoſe who own ſuch, are not ſhe,

               <p>Laſtly, <hi>All wicked works,</hi> all pride, all vain glory, all envy, malice, hatred, revenge, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is of the fleſh, this is all included under this notion or figure, to wit, the <hi>Moon;</hi> for as ſhe rules by <hi>night,</hi> ſhe does ſignifie nothing but a <hi>ſtate of ignorance,</hi> and of darkneſs, which is the Kingdom of the <hi>Devil.</hi>

                  <p>And now my Brethren, take all theſe Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers together, and ſeek for ſuch a Church, and beg of God that you may find her; and though ſhe go into a <hi>wilderneſs,</hi> go with her, for ſhe is the <hi>Lambs wife:</hi> you read in the following part of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe muſt go <hi>into the wilderneſs,</hi> but there is a place provided for her; though the <hi>Dragon</hi> ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth all his threatnings, yet ſhe ſhall be ſafe.

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41194:89"/>grow up in Chriſt, into a likeneſs to him. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, look for a Church that is <hi>meek and humble;</hi> where you ſee a boiſterous Church, a cruel, a bloody and revengeful Church, that is not the Church, that is liker a man, and not like a <hi>wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> Put on <hi>patience,</hi> if you would look like the Church of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And again, ſee what <hi>doctrine</hi> they hold; do they keep cloſe to this <hi>Bible?</hi> if not, reject them, tell them they are not of Gods people; why, I do not ſee upon your heads the <hi>Crown of twelve ſtars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, ſee what <hi>garment</hi> ſhe weareth? does ſhe wear a garment made of Chriſts ſufferings? look and hope for a juſtification that way, by the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of Chriſt; 'tis not the <hi>woman</hi> that is found in her <hi>own righteouſneſs,</hi> but in Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>Again, if you find them crying up the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſts Juſtification, and have <hi>not the righteouſneſs of Sanctification,</hi> they are none of the <hi>woman;</hi> that is the <hi>Church,</hi> where there is claim to the <hi>righteouſneſs of Juſtification,</hi> and a care taken for the <hi>righteouſneſs of ſanctification;</hi> theſe are to accompany each other.</p>

                  </bibl>
                  <q>Shall there be evil in a city, and the Lord hath not done it?</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>IN the year 1666, a year never to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, God did viſit this City with a great and fearful fire; when you then ſaw all in flames, and that there was no ſtopping of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring fire, but it went on raging till it had brought all to aſhes, the great queſtion then in <hi>London</hi> was, How came this fire? was it accidental,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41194:92"/>or was it by deſign? My Brethren, this part of the verſe that I have opened, will give you light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that queſtion, and will help you to know who it was that burnt <hi>London,</hi> it was the Lord, even that God which is the Author of every evil that is in a City; for ſaith the Lord, <hi>Is there any evil in a city, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſhort, it was God burnt <hi>London,</hi> and God will juſtifie it; you need go no further to enquire into the Author of it, <hi>I have done it,</hi> ſaith the Lord.</p>
               <p>The words you ſee are an Interrogation, <hi>Is there any evil in a city?</hi> But you may turn it into an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, and then the words run thus, <hi>There is no evil in a city but the Lord hath done it.</hi> Theſe words are a concluſion that do depend upon the premiſed verſes for their illuſtration. In the firſt verſe of this Chapter, God by his Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> as by his Herald, doth proclaim War againſt the Twelve Tribes, he declareth himſelf to be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, an enemy to them: <hi>Hear,</hi> ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>this word that the Lord hath ſpoken againſt you. I come with a word againſt you:</hi> why, who are theſe, you? who, the whole Family which I brought out of the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with every one of you, I have a word againſt you all; not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Ten Tribes, but I have a word of the Lord againſt <hi>Judah</hi> likewiſe, even againſt the whole family of <hi>Jacob</hi> that I brought out of <hi>Egypt. I have a word;</hi> that is, I have a word of threatning, I have a Proclamation of War from the great God againſt you. But this is ſtrange, that God ſhould have but one people in all the world, and that God ſhould fall out with them at this time! all the reſt
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41194:92"/>of the Nations were all Heathens, they were all Idolaters, all worſhippers of the Devil. And this people of the Twelve Tribes at that time, was the only people that God had in all the world, and yet God here entreth into a War with that very peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people; <hi>Go,</hi> ſaith he to <hi>Amos, tell Iſrael that I am againſt them. I have a word againſt them.</hi> It is true, becauſe they were ſuch a priviledged people, they had much ado ever to believe any Prophet that came with any ſad tidings againſt them. For ſtill when the Prophet came to threaten them with Gods wrath and vengeance, they put all off with this: Are we not the ſeed of <hi>Abraham?</hi> Are we not a people in Covenant? Have we not the mark of the Covenant about us? Are not we the people that of all the people in the world God only know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? We will never believe that God will turn enemy againſt us. To this ſaith the Prophet, Yea, but God hath, even againſt you, whom he did ſo ſignally deliver, when he brought you by a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hand out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> even that very people, you; I had it in my commiſſion to you; you whoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers I delivered with an out ſtretched arm out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Therefore do not flatter your ſelves, to wit, that God hath been the God of your fathers, and therefore will not puniſh you their ſeed. I tell you I am ſent to you: But God hath known us, ſurely he will not fall out with us for old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſake. Saith the Prophet, It is true, you are the people that God hath known of old, and hath known as a friend, hath known you familiarly: <hi>You only have I known of all the families of the earth:</hi> I grant it, ſaith God; I have known you in a way
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41194:93"/>of mercy; I knew you when I choſe you in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> I knew you in bondage; I knew you when I delivered you out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> I knew you at the Red-ſea when I wrought a wonder to ſave you; I have known you at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> when I gave you my Law; I have known you in bringing of you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Canaan,</hi> a land flowing with milk and honey. I know you well enough, ſaith God. And I know you likewiſe by your ſins as well as my mercies. I know you, and your fathers too, have been a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious generation, that have always provoked me bitterly; that provoked me ten times in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. I knew you how you turned unto <hi>Baal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peor;</hi> I knew you in all your ingratitude; and therefore will I puniſh you. I know you as a people of the greateſt mercies that ever were in the world, that ever I manifeſted to the ſons of men; and I know you to be as ungrateful a people. I know you, and therefore I will puniſh you. But ſtill will God puniſh? ſo difficult a thing it is to bring off a profeſſing people from ſelf-flattery. How? it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be: theſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were ready to ſay, What God turn enemy to us! what, God that hath been ſuch a great friend, and ſo long a friend! What, God that walked with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob!</hi> What, God that led us out of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and carried us as an Eagle her young ones upon her wings forty years through a Wilderneſs! What will God threaten us, and deſtroy us! no ſurely, it cannot be. Well, the Prophet obviates this too, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Can two walk together except they be agreed?</hi> True, I did walk with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> with me; I did walk with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41194:93"/>
                  <hi>Iſaac</hi> walked with me; that is in ways of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, as <hi>Enoch</hi> is ſaid to walk with God; that is, in a righteous life. But, ſaith God, now we are not agreed; when you and I were agreed, then you walked in my judgments, and in my ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes; and I walked with you in ways of mercy, and we were good friends; I did but ſpeak, and you obeyed; you did but ask, and I gave. But now, ſaith God, you and I am fallen out; you have broken my laws; my ſtatutes and my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are forſaken by you; I can live no longer with you, and I muſt part; we had as good part, we are not agreed; your ways and my ways, your nature and my nature are quite contrary; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſaith he, I will part from you.</p>
               <p>Thus you have the meaning of the firſt three verſes; we proceed to the 4th verſe. God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what would be the event of this meſſage, which is, that they would not believe it; He adds, But will they not believe I am thus angry? Go tell them, ſaith God, <hi>Amos</hi> go tell them, <hi>Will a Lion roar in the foreſt when he hath no prey? will a young Lion cry out of his den if he hath taken nothing?</hi> What is the meaning of that? It is obſerved of the Lion, that beaſt of the foreſt, that he ſeldom roars but either when he hath the prey in his paw, or the prey in his eye; when he ſeeth no prey, he roareth not; but when he hath gotten hold of the prey, and is tearing it with his paws and his teeth; or when he ſees it in his eye, then he ordinarily roareth. What doth God by the Prophet mean here? This roaring of the Lion is the threatning of the Prophet; Gods threatnings are as it were the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41194:94"/>roarings of God. Now, ſaith he, ſhall God threaten deſtruction to you Twelve Tribes, and thus roar, and do you think yet that he will not deſtroy you? believe it, he will never thus threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but he hath the prey in his eye; he eyeth you Twelve Tribes, he intends to tear you in pieces, and to give your land to another people, why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he roareth, becauſe he threatens. This is the ſenſe of the 4th verſe; the 5th follows, wherein the Lord by his Prophet beats them from another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, where he knew they would ſeek to hide their heads, and that is, that though wars and deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould come as was threatned, that they were but matters of chance incident to this world, and no argument of Gods anger towards them. This the Lord meets with in a Parable of a bird being taken in a net: <hi>Can a bird</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>fall upon a ſnare in the earth where is no gin for him? ſhall one take up a ſnare from the earth when he hath taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?</hi> He meaneth, however accidental plagues may ſeem to be to men; yet they are determined of God; when a bird is caught, it is but accidental to the bird, he lighteth and is catched in the ſnare; but it is the deliberate act, the intentional act of the fowler, for he ſets the ſnare; for what end? to catch the bird; and he taketh not up this ſnare until he hath caught it. Oh <hi>Iſrael!</hi> when ever you find your ſelves caught in the ſnare of God, when ever you ſee your ſelves deſtroyed, however acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental thoſe deſtructions may ſeem to come upon you as to ſecond cauſes; believe it, I was the fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, I laid the net, (ſaith the Lord) I did intend to catch you, it is my own work, my deſigned work.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41194:94"/>Therefore when ſuch a Judgment comes, ſay, I ſent it; when you are caught, I caught you; when you are torn in pieces, I tore you in pieces. And now in the concluſion of all this, ſaith he, <hi>Can there be evil in the city, and the Lord not do it?</hi> Theſe words they are put by way of queſtion, as I now told you; make them <hi>affirmative,</hi> and they ſhall be my Doctrine: That is then thus,
<q>Doct. <hi>There is no evil in a city but the Lord hath done it.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In the opening hereof,</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſhall ſhew you what is here meant by City.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſhall ſhew you what is meant by evil in the City.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I ſhall ſhew you how God is the author of all that evil in the City; and I ſhall ſhew you the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he doth aſſume to himſelf to be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all the evil in the City.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I ſhall ſhew you the reaſons why he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict ſo many evils upon a City: and then we ſhall come to Application.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What is here meant by <hi>City?</hi> City may be taken here either properly or improperly; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly for the rows of houſes, the ſtreets of houſes, as they are compaſſed in with walls, which are the habitations of Citizens. The City, for the houſes of the City; and then it is thus, Is there any evil befalls the Houſes of the City, but I do it? Are Cities fired and burnt to aſhes? I do it.</p>
               <p>Improperly, and here is a double <hi>Synecdoche</hi> to be underſtood in this word, <hi>City.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:41194:95"/>1. City is here taken for the things and perſons in the City, <hi>Is there any evil in a city?</hi> that is, Doth there any evil befall the Citizens of the City, or any concernment of the Citizens? and then there is another <hi>Synecdoche</hi> of the part for the whole: the City may be taken for the Kingdom, as being part of the Kingdom; nay, it may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the whole world, as being part of the whole world; ſo the ſenſe will be thus, Is there any evil in a whole Kingdom? Is there any evil in the whole world but I have done it, ſaith the Lord? God owneth himſelf to be the author of all the evil, (that is of puniſhment, I ſhall ſhew preſently) that hath been in the world from the beginning of it to the end. But then we muſt in the</p>
               <p>2d place, ſee what is meant by Evil: there is a great deal of reaſon that you ſhould be well informed hereof. There are therefore, my Brethren, two ſorts of evils which we muſt carefully diſtinguiſh.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is the evil of ſin: And,</p>
               <p n="2">2ly, There is the evil of puniſhment. The evil of ſin, that is any tranſgreſſion of, or any noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the righteous Law of God, this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly evil; the evil of ſin, yea, the greateſt evil in the world. There are no evils of what kind ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that are to be compared with this great evil of ſin. Now, my Brethren, in this ſenſe you muſt take heed of underſtanding the Prophet: God doth not here ſay, or the Prophet doth not here ſay, Is there any evil of ſin in a City, but I have done it? no, God forbid! this were the higheſt blaſphemy in the world, to make God the author of all the ſin of the City. He would be a ſtrange
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41194:95"/>God if he ſhould be the author of all <hi>London</hi>'s ſins, and all <hi>England</hi>'s ſins, and all the worlds ſins. This cannot be the meaning of the Prophet for theſe Reaſons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe God is ſo far from being the author of all the ſin in a City, or in the world, that he never committed any ſin ſince this world was; the world hath had experience of God for near ſix thouſand years, but they never found God guilty of ſin, guilty of any unrighteouſneſs. God in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he doth make uſe of this, You have departed from me, ſaith the Lord; and why are you departed from me? What cauſe have I given you to depart from me? Have your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers found (ſaith he) any iniquity in me? Have your fathers experienced any unrighteous dealings from me? Did they ever find me an oppreſſor of them? Did they ever find me to exact work, and not to give good wages? Did they ever find me to be falſe to my word? In <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, what iniquity have your fathers found in me that they are gone from me, and have walked after vanities, and are become vain?</hi> What iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! your fathers never found any iniquity in God, no, nor you neither. The righteous God never was guilty, from the foundation of the world to this time, of any unrighteouſneſs to any of his Creatures. No, here is a challenge as to all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, if they can tell any unrighteous works, or any unrighteous act that God was guilty of, and if they can challenge him for any, they may have ſomething to ſay for themſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly, God is ſo far from being the cauſe of ſin,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41194:96"/>that he doth diſclaim an having any hand in it in any ſort or kind whatever, no not ſo much as in any temptation to it; as you may ſee in <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Let no man ſay when he is tempted, I am tempted of God.</hi> That is, when any man is tempted to ſin, let no man ſay when he is thus tempted, that God tempted him to ſin. Why ſhould they not ſay ſo? Why, ſaith the Apoſtle, the reaſon is, <hi>for God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be tempted of evil, neither tempteth he any man.</hi> No man can ever tempt God to do that which is evil? neither doth God tempt any man to ſin. How come they then to be tempted? the Apoſtle tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own luſts and inticed.</hi> You are tempted of your ſelves, and of the Devil. Lay your ſins at your own door, God hath no hand at all in them.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly, God cannot be the author of the evil of ſin; Why? becauſe it is ſo contrary to the nature of God: It is ſo contrary, that it would even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, God if it were there. A ſinning God is no God at all; for the very notion of the Godhead doth imply all Perfection in him. Now ſin is the palpableſt imperfection in the world; an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect God is a weak God; and an impotent God is no almighty God; and that which is not almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is no God at all. It is a hard thing for any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to put off its nature, or that which is eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to it; now righteouſneſs is of the very eſſence of the Godhead. How hard a thing is it, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, for you to think or conceive of a Sun with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out light, or to conceive of fire without heat? ſo hard and impoſſible is it for you to conceive of a God without holineſs, a God without righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41194:96"/>yea without perfection of righteouſneſs. And therefore the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> doth reckon ſin in God as an impoſſibility; it is impoſſible for God to ſin, he inſtanceth in the caſe of falſeneſs, or a lye, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.18. that by two immutable things, that is his word and his oath, in which it was impoſſible for God to lye. Now what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here ſaith of the ſin of <hi>lying,</hi> I may ſay of all ſorts of ſin, it is as impoſſible for God to do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly, as it is impoſſible for God to lye; it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for theſe reaſons; you ſee it clear, that it is impoſſible for God to be the author of ſin. Well then, how muſt it be taken? by evil muſt be here meant the evil of puniſhment: Why is puniſhment called an evil? for this reaſon, becauſe that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth deprive us of our good things; now that which taketh away our good things, is an evil thing; puniſhment taketh away our good things, ſtrippeth us of them all, both ſpiritual and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral. Therefore puniſhment is called an evil; ſo then the ſenſe is this: Is there any puniſhment in a City? is there any evil of puniſhment? is there any plague? is there any judgment that doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall a City? ſaith the Lord, I did them, I will own them: You are not aſhamed of your ſinning, and I am not aſhamed of my puniſhing of you for your ſin. You are not aſhamed to provoke me to wrath, and I am not afraid to tell you when I am in wrath with you. Now there are ſeveral ſorts of theſe puniſhments that God doth inflict for ſin, and God doth own himſelf to be the author of them all, there are none of them to be found in the world, but God will own himſelf to be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41194:97"/>of them. There are ſome evils of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that do light upon the ſoul, and where ever you ſee of them in a City, the Lord is the author of them. All the evils, all the ſoul-plagues that are upon a City, they are of the Lord. What are theſe ſoul-plagues? why, judicial blindneſs, judicial hardneſs of heart, judicial unconvertedneſs; ſo far as theſe are judgments, ſo far God is the author of them. And alas! how much of this plague is upon <hi>London,</hi> this evil of judicial blindneſs, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, unconvertedneſs, unhealedneſs? But will God own himſelf to be the author of this; yes, he doth do it by his own Son, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.40. <hi>He hath blinded their eyes:</hi> who hath blinded their eyes? God hath blinded their eyes, he hath. God hath blinded their eyes. He hath hardened their hearts, <hi>God hath hardned their hearts, that they ſhould not ſee with their eyes, nor underſtand with their hearts, and be converted and I ſhould heal them.</hi> This is ſtrange! is it not, my Brethren, that God ſhould be the author of the blindneſs of the mind, and the hardneſs of the heart! I ſay it is as true as ſtrange; for ſo far as blindneſs is a judgment, ſo far as hardneſs of heart is a judgment; not as it is a ſin, but as it is a judgment, God is the cauſe of it: but if you ſhould be ſtartled as to wonder how poſſibly it could be that God ſhould be the author of blindneſs and hardneſs; if you will but compare this phraſe unto that other kind of phraſe which the Apoſtle uſeth in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> Rom. 1.26. the matter will be clear, Chriſt ſaith God hath blinded them; the Apoſtle he expreſſeth it by a phraſe of giving up to ſin.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41194:97"/>God he then blindeth, and then hardeneth, when he giveth up to blindneſs, that is that blindneſs that men have contracted; when he giveth them up to that hardneſs of heart that by ſin they have contracted to themſelves: <hi>For this cauſe</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>God gave them up unto vile affections</hi> (God gave them up to them) <hi>for even their women to change their natural uſe to that which is againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> God gave them up to it. All the Villanies that were acted among the Heathens, all thoſe abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable ſins that they polluted themſelves with, God gave them up in judgment to commit them. And truly when you look over this City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and you find all ſorts of ſins in a high degree to abound; when you hear of ſins that are not to be named, though theſe ſins are of mens own wicked hearts, yet as they are judgments, ſo they are of God. God gives them up to drunkenneſs, and up to ſwearing, and up to adultery and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs; ſo far as theſe are judgments, they are to be attributed to God. God gives them up to them. And it is like that other phraſe that the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> uſeth, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Ephraim is join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Idols, let him alone.</hi> If you would know when God giveth up a people to blindneſs, and giveth them up to hardneſs, it is then when he lets them alone in their blindneſs, when he lets them alone in their hardneſs; when doth he let them alone? when he taketh off friends from reproving them, and Miniſters from exhorting them, and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from troubling them; giving them up to ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redneſs of Conſcience, when he takes off the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from ſtriving with them, then he lets them alone.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41194:98"/>So to let a people alone in their blindneſs, to give them Prieſts after their own hearts, to give them thoſe that will ſew cuſhions under their elbows, and will flatter them in their ſins, and tell them it is an eaſie matter to pleaſe God, and get to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and therefore need not be at the expence of much trouble. When God giveth them up, I ſay, to ſuch Prieſts and ſuch friends as will flatter them in their ſins, daub over their iniquities, then he lets them alone, then he is ſaid judicially to blind their minds, and harden their hearts, that they ſhould not be converted and healed. Oh what a great deal of this plague is upon <hi>London!</hi> and truly, Sirs, this is a worſe plague than that of the Peſtilence; this plague exceeds the Plague of <hi>Sixty-five,</hi> and exceeds the great plague of the Fire, for which you humble your ſelves this day. It is worſe than Plague and Fire: why? becauſe thoſe other plagues are but the litter of this Coccatrice eggs, all hatched in this womb of ſin; <hi>London</hi>'s blindneſs, <hi>London</hi>'s hardneſs of heart under the light of the Goſpel, was the cauſe of <hi>London</hi>'s Fire, and <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>'s Peſtilence. It were well if there were a Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day appointed all over <hi>England</hi> to bewail this great plague of blindneſs of mind, and hardneſs of heart; this judicial blindneſs and hardneſs that is as it were ſpread like a leproſie all over <hi>England;</hi> this is a plague we are not ſenſible of, little affected with, Why? becauſe it is inviſible in the ſoul. The fire that flamed and caſt a dreadful ſmoke, and affected our ſenſes, looked like <hi>Sodom,</hi> yea like Hell it ſelf, theſe we are affected with; and when we ſee our dying friends look pale, and ſee them gaſp and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41194:98"/>groan, this we are affected with; but for blind ſouls, dead ſouls, poyſoned ſouls, poyſoned with ſin, being full of ſin, and full of Hell, gaſping and dying, and going to Hell, no body is affected with this; how few hearts are affected with this, and thoſe leaſt upon whom this plague is!</p>
               <p n="2">2ly, There is another ſort of evils, and thoſe are ſuch that reach the body: <hi>Is there any evil in a city but I have done it?</hi> That is, Is there any puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the body? there is not. My Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, you never know God aright, you never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore him aright, you never fear him aright, till you can ſee him concerned with every thing that you meet with in the world; yea, every evil. God doth look ſo narrowly unto all that you are and have, that there is not one hair of your heads can fall to the ground without his Providence; there is not an aking head but God hath a hand in it; the leaſt pain on your body that is inflicted, it is by a direction from God. There is not one evil in a whole City, no not among all the inhabitants of a City, but I have done it, ſaith the Lord; all the croſſings of your family, all of them, every one of them; whatever be the ſecond cauſes that are at work, God is the firſt; he is the firſt great wheel. There is not an evil; all thoſe burning fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, agues, all the pains of the Stone or Gout, all thoſe Plague-ſores, thoſe Boils and Blains, let the diſeaſe be what it will, what it can, as it is a puniſhment, God is the author of it, God inflicts it.</p>
               <p>And then there is another ſort of evils; there are many of them indeed, but another, that which
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41194:99"/>reſpects the eſtate; there is not one evil that may befall your eſtate in this world, but God is the author of it. Would you in <hi>London</hi> but believe this, it would be of great uſe to you: you never loſe one farthing but God knoweth of it, and he hath a hand in it. You never truſt a man, and he deceiveth you, but God giveth you up to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by that man. You never truſted a man that breaketh through poverty, but God knew it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, and gave you up to lend him, or to truſt him. There is not a Ship miſcarrieth by Sea, but it is of the Lord it miſcarrieth. Oh that you were but well acquainted with this Doctrine, then would you learn to acknowledg God in all your ways, and in all his works of Providence that you meet with in the world; and if there is none of theſe evils can follow your eſtate without God, then ſurely <hi>London</hi> could not be burnt without God; for if the leaſt evil, how much more the greateſt evil? So that here you ſee it was the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> that burnt this City, a few years ſince he burnt it to aſhes, he would not have the fire ſtopt, he would have it go on raging till it had finiſhed his Decree; he would have it ſo, the Lord hath done it, he owneth it this day that you are met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and hath in his Providence ſent me to tell you that God burnt <hi>London,</hi> God burnt it. Do not therefore much trouble your ſelves about Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, though likely ſome might be wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in it, yet it was God that did the thing. I have done it, ſaith the Lord. Doubtleſs it it of an humbling conſideration to us this day, now we are come before the Lord. But then the queſtion will be in the</p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:41194:99"/>
               <p>Third place, How may God be ſaid to be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all puniſhment? How is it that God doth burn Cities, deſtroy Families, Kingdoms? how doth he do it? There are two ways that God may be ſaid to be the author of all the puniſhments that are in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> God is the author of them by his decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> God is the author of them by ſeeing to means that ſhall certainly execute them. God in his Decree appoints the end; and God in his Providence provides the means too; ſo that if they be decreed by God, and theſe Decrees exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by God, then God may truly be ſaid to be author of them: I have done them, ſaith God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Then God is the author of all puniſhment in a City, in as much as when ever theſe evils come upon a City or people, they are firſt decreed by God; they do not come by chance, they are of Gods laying on, as the Prophet intimateth. God hath determined of them before hand; and this will be clear if you do but conſult ſeveral like caſes; when evils have befallen a world of people, and befallen Cities, they came not accidentally, but they came by the determinate counſel of God. We will give you ſome of theſe inſtances: One of the moſt univerſal plagues that God ever poured down upon this world, was that of the Deluge, when he drowned it: Why, whence come theſe waters? from God. Who drowned the World? I did, ſaith God. What, didſt not thou ſpare, except thoſe eight perſons, man, woman, nor child? no, not one, I ſpared none of them, but drowned them
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41194:100"/>all. What was it done raſhly, inconſiderately, as men uſe to do in a paſſion, doing that in haſte that they repent at leiſure? No, no, God thought of it long before, ſixſcore years before the world was drowned, it was determined of God it ſhould be drowned (he had paſſed his Decree upon it) for their iniquities, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.7. <hi>And the Lord ſaid, I will deſtroy man whom I have created</hi> (I will do it, ſaith God) <hi>from the face of the earth, both man and beaſt, and the creeping things, and the fowls of the air, for it repenteth me that I have made man.</hi> I will do it, ſaith the Lord. Lord! when wilt thou do it? I will do it, ſaith he, about ſixſcore years hence. I will give them ſo much time to repent in, to ſee what they will do: verſ. 3. <hi>For the Lord ſaid, my ſpirit ſhall not always ſtrive with man, for that he alſo is fleſh, yet his days ſhall be an hundred and twenty years.</hi> That is between the threatning and between the performance, between the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that the Deluge was of God, it was of Gods deliberate determination, he decreed it, he was the author of it. So again, as to the burning of <hi>Sodom,</hi> God firſt ſitteth in judgment upon <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> trieth <hi>Sodom,</hi> heareth evidence againſt <hi>Sodom,</hi> caſts her, paſſeth ſentence upon her, and all this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore execution day: the righteous Judg of the world did proceed righteouſly, he hath a trial and a ſentence before execution. And as he dealt with <hi>Sodom,</hi> doubtleſs he dealt with <hi>London</hi> too. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.20, 21. <hi>Sodom</hi> had grievouſly ſinned to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God, as <hi>London</hi> may have done; and there came continual tidings from earth to heaven, <hi>Lot</hi> ſent them up in his lamentations, good Angels per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41194:100"/>declaims againſt them, crying out, How long, how long, holy and true, wilt thou ſpare yonder wicked <hi>Sodom? And the Lord ſaid, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and becauſe their ſin is very grievous, I will go down now and ſee whether they have done altogether accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cry of it which is come unto me; and if not I will know.</hi> I will deal very fairly with them, I will not burn them without they deſerve it. And you know the Lord ſent two Angels, who came to <hi>Lots</hi> houſe, who were eye-witneſſes of their abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations; for thither came the wretched <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> there to force the men that came to <hi>Lot</hi>'s houſe: and what was the iſſue of it? <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.13. <hi>Haſte thee hence</hi> (ſaith the Angels) <hi>we will deſtroy this place.</hi> There is the ſentence, <hi>for we will deſtroy this place, becauſe the cry of them is waxen great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the face of the Lord, and the Lord hath ſent us to deſtroy it.</hi> And do you think, my Brethren, (though it may be perhaps hard for you to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it) do you think <hi>London</hi> was not tried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore burnt, as well as <hi>Sodom?</hi> ay, no doubt <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>'s drunkenneſs, and uncleanneſs, and formality, cried in the ears of the Lord God of Sabbaths: God looked down to ſee what <hi>London</hi> did, and how <hi>London</hi> lived, and how <hi>London</hi> improved the Goſpel it had; and upon trial it was found too light; and God ſent them firſt the Peſtilence, then the Fire. Firſt, deſtroy the Citizens with the Plague, ſaith God; then burn the City. God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed it, it was decreed before done. The Lord help us to have reverent thoughts of God in all his works here among the children of men.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:41194:101"/>
               <p>Again, I might inſtance in two more, and that was the firſt and ſecond deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> They were deſtroyed; who deſtroyed them? the Lord deſtroyed them. How was the Lord ſaid to be the author of the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> becauſe it was decreed before it was done. God decreed the deſtruction of it, and God ſent <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> to tell the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that he would bring the <hi>Babylonians</hi> upon them, a ſtrong and mighty Nation; God had purpoſed to do it, and that many years before he did it: It had paſt in the ſentence of God, the judgment of God was paſt upon them. So again the ſecond time when the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was deſtroyed and burnt by <hi>Titus Veſpaſian,</hi> when it was burnt, deſtroyed, and laid deſolate by the <hi>Romans;</hi> it is true, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were the Executioners, but it was God that had paſt the judgment upon them. Nay, it had paſſed in the judgment of God five hundred years before it was done. God had reckoned with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> reckoned up their ſins from their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, he had kept an account of them all from generation to generation; and foretold their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from the time of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which was to the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> about five hundred years, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.26. and what <hi>Daniel</hi> foretold ſo long before, that Jeſus Chriſt foretold in his day to be nigh at hand. Chriſt looking upon that beautiful ſtructure of the Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> in the 24th of <hi>Mat.</hi> ſaith unto them, Do you not ſee a beautiful Temple here, the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem? Verily I ſay unto you, there ſhall not be left here one ſtone upon another that ſhall not be thrown
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41194:101"/>down.</hi> How did Chriſt know that? Chriſt knew that his Father had determined to deſtroy the Temple. How long before? near five hundred years: For it is ſpoken of about five hundred years before by <hi>Daniel,</hi> as I have ſaid: <hi>When ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall ſee the abomination of deſolation ſpoken of by Daniel the Prophet, ſtand in the holy place,</hi> (that is, compaſs the City, beſiege the City) <hi>whoſo read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth let him underſtand.</hi> Why ſo? for now is the time ſpoken of by <hi>Daniel</hi> for to deſtroy this City, and for to deſtroy this Temple. Thus you ſee in theſe inſtances how God is the author of all the puniſhment that is in the world, in as much as he doth decree it before it comes to paſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> God is the author of all the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe he ſeeth, he provideth means and inſtruments for the execution of his Decrees. God doth not only ſay, let ſuch a plague come, let ſuch a fire come; but God taketh care to ſee it done: When God will have a thing done, there ſhall not want inſtruments, it ſhall be done in a way and manner of his own contriving. If you will ask me who are theſe executioners of Gods decrees in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting puniſhments upon this world, upon the Kingdoms, and Cities, and Towns, and Perſons thereof? I anſwer you, the whole Creation, all the parts of it, they all ſtand ready as Miniſters of God to do his pleaſure; when God will have any puniſhment inflicted, both Heaven, and Sea, and Earth, Men and Devils, they are all ready to execute his wrath and vengeance upon the World. The Heavens they are the executioners of Gods decree to puniſh men. When God had a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41194:102"/>mind to defeat <hi>Siſera</hi>'s army, the very Stars in their courſes ſtood on Gods ſide and fought againſt <hi>Siſera.</hi> You have ſuch a paſſage as that is in the <hi>Judges, The ſtars fought againſt Gods enemies;</hi> the clouds, the hail, they are ready to do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they are capable in executing Gods wrath; when God would puniſh the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and their Cattel with Hail, the Clouds they did as miniſters of God charge themſelves with Hail, and diſcharge like ſo many Harquibuſſes, diſcharged themſelves again upon the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and their Cattel, and deſtroyed multitudes of them. The Winds they are ready to ſerve the Lord, and to do what ever he would have them do; The Winds: ye ſhall ſee how <hi>David</hi> put them all together as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, ſervants of God, ready to do his pleaſure, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.8. <hi>Fire, hail, ſnow and vapours, ſtormy winds, fulfilling his word:</hi> they all ſtand ready at the word of God, to go and come, to do what God will have them do, all of them ready to fulfil his word. Will God uſe the Seas to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the wicked? thoſe ſenſeleſs creatures, thoſe deaf creatures, they have ears to hear the word of God. God had puniſhed <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his hoſt, and his people in <hi>Egypt</hi> ten times, yet <hi>Phareah</hi> was not ſatisfied, but followed <hi>Iſrael</hi> to the Red-Sea; now God will make the Sea to puniſh <hi>Pharoah,</hi> the very Sea can do it. God ſpake but the word, and thoſe great waters (a wonderful thing!) divided hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and thither, and contrary unto their natures, ſtood like two cryſtal walls congealed, until the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> paſſed through; but when <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his hoſt aſſayed to do the like, God ſpoke the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41194:102"/>word, and like two Jaws they cloſe again, and devoured <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his hoſt. The Sea was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner of Gods wrath upon that proud-hearted King. Look upon things upon the earth, they are all ready to execute vengeance upon Gods ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; the Fly, the Locuſt, the Caterpiller, yea, the very Lice, God maketh uſe of to bring down the proud heart of <hi>Pharoah;</hi> and not only theſe inferiour creatures but all ſorts of creatures, yea the very Devils and wicked men ſtand ready to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute wrath even upon thoſe that are as wicked as themſelves. The very Devils, if God hath a mind to puniſh a man, they will be ready to run to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the puniſhment. They will do it, nay, they are very deſirous, they would go more about this work of plaguing and puniſhing men, than God is willing they ſhould do; and it was meer impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, as I may ſay, whereby the Devil did get God to try <hi>Job.</hi> It is true, thoſe afflictions came not in wrath upon <hi>Job,</hi> but for trial; but however it was in wrath from the Devil. But God giveth the Devil leave to burn <hi>Job</hi> his Cattel by fire from Heaven, to raiſe a mighty ſtorm, to bring the houſe down upon the heads of his children while feaſting; to ſtir up the <hi>Sabeans</hi> to come into the field and take away his Cattel. And what he doth here for <hi>Job,</hi> ſo he will do it for thoſe that are otherwiſe his profeſſed friends and followers. <hi>Ahab</hi> was a good ſervant of the Devil, but <hi>Ahab</hi> had angred God, and God was reſolved he would ſpare him no longer, but cut him off. How will God cut him off? He ſhall be cut off in battel, ſaith God. But how ſhall <hi>Ahab</hi> be brought to the battel?
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41194:103"/>there ſteps one out, <hi>a lying ſpirit, I will be a lying ſpirit in the mouth of Ahab his falſe Prophets, and theſe falſe Prophets ſhall perſwade Ahab to go to the battel, and there thou ſhalt cut him off.</hi> This was the Devil, the Devil that had put <hi>Ahab</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Idolatry; the Devil that had put <hi>Ahab</hi> upon ſelling himſelf to do wickedly, the Devil is readieſt to do execution upon <hi>Ahab</hi> when his time is come. Saith God, he hath been falſe and treacherous to me, Go and be a lying ſpirit in the mouth of his Prophets, and they ſhall prevail upon him to lead him out to the battel, and I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide an arrow that ſhall take away his life. Wicked men are ready to do execution upon any people that God is angry with. God threatneth his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> I will but hiſs for ſuch a people, and they will all come: What a great people were the <hi>Babylonians;</hi> I will but becken, I will but nod, I will but ſpeak a word, and all that great Empire of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall be in arms: For what? to pull thee in pieces, Oh <hi>Judah,</hi> and Oh <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> So likewiſe if there were any inſtruments that did wilfully help forward the burning of the City, I tell you they had all their orders. But will God give wicked men order to do thus wickedly? no. God only gives them order to inflict the evil as it is a puniſhment, no otherwiſe; what wickedneſs there is in the <hi>principle</hi> of him that is the executioner, that is to himſelf. God gave commiſſion to the Devil to burn <hi>Job</hi>'s Cattel, and to deſtroy <hi>Job</hi>'s Children; the Devil doth it maliciouſly, and with an intent to make <hi>Job</hi> blaſpheme God: Ay, but God doth only give leave for the trying of <hi>Job.</hi> So when God maketh uſe of wicked
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41194:103"/>men to inflict a judgment, he intendeth nothing but the demonſtration of his righteouſneſs againſt ſin, but wicked men they may have malicious ends of their own. So if God ſhould give leave to men to burn the City, I tell you, though the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be wicked, and do it wickedly, they are crooked ſtaves, but yet therewith God ſtrikes a right ſtroke, a right blow. It was ſin in <hi>Judas</hi> to betray his Maſter, &amp; yet the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> tells you it was according to the determinate counſel of God. God had ſo ordered it in his Providence, that <hi>Judas</hi> ſhould be one of the twelve that ſhould betray Chriſt; ſo ye ſee that God is the author of all the evil of puniſhment, but not of the evil of ſin. He is the author of it by decreeing of it, by providing means to affect his Decree.</p>
               <p>But then laſtly, we ſhall add the reaſons here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, when God doth bring evil upon a City: Why doth God bring evil upon a City? I anſwer you, the principal reaſon for which God doth bring evil upon a City, it their ſin; for their ſins and their puniſhments are relatives; where there is no ſin, there is no ſuch thing as puniſhment. The Fire of <hi>London</hi> ſo far as it was <hi>London</hi>'s puniſhment, it doth reſpect the ſin of <hi>London,</hi> it was for ſin. This is very clear in all the Judgments that we read of, they are all for ſin. Why did God drown the old world? becauſe their imaginations were evil, and that continually, it was for ſin. Why did God burn <hi>Sodom?</hi> it was for ſin; their ſins cried in the ears of God. Why did God threaten the Twelve Tribes? it was for ſin. Why was ten of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> about threeſcore and ten
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41194:104"/>years after this <hi>Amos</hi> propheſied? it was for ſin. God telleth us ſo. And why was <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the <hi>Babylonians?</hi> for their ſin. And ſo the reſt. And if ſo, if ſin is the cauſe of all the Judgments you read of in the Book of God, then you muſt conclude where there was ſo great a Judgment, ſo great a puniſhment inflicted upon <hi>London,</hi> it was for ſin; it was for the ſin of <hi>London.</hi> Why, what ſins are there that God is ſo angry with? they are of two ſorts, there are ſins againſt nature, or the Law written upon the heart; and there are ſins againſt the Goſpel, againſt the grace of God in Chriſt Jeſus. The ſins againſt the law written in the heart, they are enumerated in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28. <hi>They liked not to retain God in their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, to do the things which are not convenient, being filled with all unrighteouſneſs, fornication, covetouſneſs, malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, whiſperers;</hi> and ſo he goeth on, theſe are ſins againſt nature, againſt the law of nature, and uſually theſe are the ſins for which God doth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Gentiles, or thoſe that never had the Law nor Goſpel. But then the ſins againſt the Goſpel, are the greateſt ſins, becauſe they are againſt a moſt eaſie, gracious, merciful Law. God will more puniſh for ſins againſt the Goſpel, than for thoſe ſins that are againſt the Law of nature. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> ſinned againſt the Law written upon her heart, but the <hi>Jews</hi> they ſinned againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and therefore were the greateſt ſinners. Let Chriſt be judg: <hi>I tell you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>it ſhall be more tollerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the great
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41194:104"/>day, than it ſhall be for you.</hi> More tolerable, why? for if they had had the means that you have had, they would have repented. They had ſinned, but they had not the means of repentance, or at leaſt not ſuch means as you have had; for you have had not only the means of the Law to convert yon, Oh <hi>Jews,</hi> but you have had the means of the Goſpel. The means of the Goſpel doth as it were lift a people up unto Heaven, it bringeth them as near to Heaven as means can bring them; and thus was <hi>Bethſaida</hi> and <hi>Corazin</hi> lifted up with, What? with the means of the grace of the Goſpel? they had the preaching of Chriſt among them, but they did deſpiſe theſe means, and continue in their infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore were thrown down to Hell, as Chriſt threatned them. And ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> (I am ſhewing of you that ſins againſt the Goſpel are the greateſt ſins) <hi>If a trangreſſion againſt the Law of Moſes deſerveth death, and was puniſhed by death, of how much ſorer puniſhment ſhall they be thought worthy that do neglect ſo great ſalvation?</hi> That is, the Goſpel-ſalvation; Goſpel-ſins are the greateſt ſins; when God puniſheth, he puniſheth for both.</p>
               <p>And now I have ſpoken to the four parts.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Application.</head>
                  <p>Let me make a ſhort <hi>Application,</hi> and I ſhall conclude. Doth it thus appear that God is the author of all the puniſhments that are upon a City, are you convinced of it, my Brethren? are you ſatisfied by what I have ſaid, That there is no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment that befalls any perſon, any family, any
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41194:105"/>City, but it is of Gods appointing, and of Gods executing; that is, he provideth and ſeeth to the execution of it? Is this true? Then you have in the</p>
                  <p>Firſt place, a clear and a full information of the author of the burning of your City. Who did burn <hi>London?</hi> why, what was the burning of <hi>London,</hi> an evil? ay, and a great one too. Was it ſo? Be it then known to all you <hi>Londoners,</hi> ſaith the Lord, you that are the Citizens thereof, be it known to you, I did burn this City, and I do this day own it. God doth own it this day. God hath burnt it. I know you may be ready to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of inſtruments; and ſurely if there were any, they were wicked inſtruments; for as I told you before in ſeveral inſtances, God may make uſe of wicked inſtruments to do his work, to inflict his puniſhments. God made uſe of lying Prophets to deceive <hi>Ahab,</hi> for to bring <hi>Ahabs</hi> death about; and God made uſe of <hi>Judas</hi> his Treaſon to bring the puniſhment of the iniquity of us all upon the back of Jeſus Chriſt. But my Brethren, whoever were the inſtruments, God is the principal effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. Pray will you remember and carry it home with you, God did it. How did God do it? God did decree it, it came doubtleſs according to the determinate counſel of God. For as the world was not drowned without an antecedent decree; nor <hi>Sodom</hi> burned without an antecedent decree, nor <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the firſt and ſecond time deſtroyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an antecedent decree; ſo doubtleſs this City of <hi>London</hi> did not come to aſhes without the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God, it was before determined in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41194:105"/>of God; and as God did decree it, ſo God in his Providence took order for all the means that were employed to the burning thereof. God had a hand in giving leave to all the leſſer wheels to work. It was God that by ſix week or two months hot weather did purpoſely dry the Houſes of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to make them fuel fit for the fire. Would you have believed it? the weather was the Lords, the Lord cauſed it. When it was fired, that men wanted wiſdom or courage, or ſucceſs to put it out, God took away their wiſdom; God took away their courage; God ſtood by, and as it were ſaid, Hands off, I intend to execute my wrath upon <hi>London,</hi> touch it not, let it go on. Magiſtrates do nothing, or if you do, let it be to no purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Again, God provided a wind, that when the fire began at one end, God ordered the wind to blow it on to the other end. The wind came out of the hollow of Gods hand, it was no caſual thing, no accidental thing, my Brethren, it was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the predeterminate Counſel of God.</p>
                  <p>That is the firſt thing; if God be the cauſe of all the evil of puniſhment, then of the burning of <hi>London,</hi> God hath done it; who ever was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, God was the principal cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if God burnt <hi>London,</hi> then in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place let us this day learn to be ſilent under the hand of God, let us not queſtion nor quarrel with his Providence; let us not ſay to the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, why haſt thou done ſo? Let us not have a thought riſe up againſt him, as to charge him foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly; let us be ſilent, nay, let us not too eagerly in our paſſion run out and vent our ſelves againſt
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41194:106"/>any that were inſtruments, for that is to do like the Dog that ſnarls and gnaws the ſtaff and run af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſtone, and gnaweth the ſtone, but never regards the hand that threw the ſtone, nor the hand that ſtrikes with the ſtaff; you vent your anger and wrath againſt the inſtruments, alas! the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they were but rods in the hand of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, they were but the ſtone and the ſtaff, alas! they were in the hand of God, he could have fruſtrated them if he would, but he had ſo order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in his Providence to give men leave to execute their malice upon <hi>London;</hi> let us lay our han<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> upon our mouths, and not murmur againſt the Lord; let us acknowledg that ſince it is the evil of puniſhment, it was a juſt one, for never did City deſerve to be burnt as <hi>London</hi> did. Never! No, ſay you! What do you think of <hi>Sodom?</hi> do you think that we are as bad as they? I tell you, worſe; you are worſe, you are as much worſe than <hi>Sodom,</hi> as <hi>Bethſaida</hi> was worſe than <hi>Sodom.</hi> Why, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was <hi>Bethſaida</hi> worſe? becauſe <hi>Bethſaida</hi> did ſin under Goſpel-light, and ſo did <hi>London.</hi> Never had a people more of the Goſpel than you have had; never Miniſters more gifted than you have had; never a Miniſtry more drawn out in their affections after your Converſion than you have had; and yet <hi>London</hi> have blinded their eyes, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened their hearts, and would not be converted, So that you deſerved it more than <hi>Sodom,</hi> and it will be more tolerable for <hi>Sodom</hi> in the day of Judgment than for you. Humble your ſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore under his mighty hand: Why, how ſhall we humble our ſelves? by confeſſing it was juſtly done.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41194:106"/>Take the courſe that <hi>Daniel</hi> did upon a Faſt-day, as this may be, when he was interceding with God for the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to bring them back out of Captivity, as you are this day, that God would not burn it again; he did it by confeſſing of ſin, and all ſorts of ſin, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.5. <hi>O Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thou art a great God, a God on thy part keeping co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and promiſe to them that love thee, and keep thy commandments; but as for us, we have ſinned and committed iniquity, and done wickedly, and have rebelled even by departing from thy precepts, and from thy judgments: neither have we hearkened to thy ſervants the Prophets which ſpake in thy name, to our King, and Princes, and Fathers; O Lord, righteouſneſs belongeth to thee, but to us belongeth confuſion of face.</hi> To us, who of us? to our King, to our Princes, to our Fathers, all deſerve to be put to ſhame: why? becauſe we have ſinned againſt thee. This is our work this day to humble our ſelves before God, to humble our ſelves for our ſins here in this City againſt God, whereby he was provoked to burn our Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Is God the cauſe of all puniſhments? and are all puniſhments for ſin? then from hence you may gather that <hi>London</hi> is a very wicked City. Why? becauſe God is very angry with it: and it is certain, he is never angry without great cauſe; men may be angry without a cauſe, and we may chide one another without a cauſe; yet God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is angry without cauſe; and in as much as God hath ſhewn himſelf angry with <hi>London,</hi> it is a ſign <hi>London</hi> hath given God a great deal of cauſe for
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41194:107"/>his anger: What cauſe hath <hi>London</hi> given God to be angry with them? Truly when I begin to think of <hi>London</hi>'s ſins, they are ſo many that it puzzles me where to begin, or where to make an end; but however let us name ſome of them; why did God burn <hi>London?</hi> for <hi>London</hi>'s pride; <hi>London</hi> had lifted it ſelf up in pride againſt God, and God pull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>London</hi> down, he pulled it into aſhes to make the proud ones of <hi>London</hi> know what they are, and what their Cities are, nothing but duſt and aſhes. My Brethren, God is a great enemy againſt pride; for the great King of <hi>Babylon</hi>'s pride he took away his reaſon, and turned him into a beaſt, and turned him a grazing with the Cattel. Pride! God reſiſteth the proud, he is a great enemy to the proud, a great adverſary to them, and to their projects and deſigns, but he ſheweth grace to the humble. Wherein doth <hi>London</hi> appear proud? proud in their Apparel, proud in their Houſes, proud in their geſtures, proud in their Profeſſions, they are guilty of all theſe ſorts of pride. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand to ſpeak much of it, but the Lord open your underſtandings and your hearts that you may ſee where the guilt lyeth; the fantaſtick dreſſes of many of the <hi>Londoners,</hi> that is one ſort; the pride of their hearts, that's another ſort. The next ſort of ſins are <hi>London</hi>'s luxury, drunkenneſs, gluttony, their exceſſive feaſting, their prodigal expences. <hi>London</hi> is a wanton City; inſtead of worſhipping God in ſpirit, it is a City, for a great part, that ſacrificeth as it were unto <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Ceres;</hi> they make their belly their god; Oh the drunkenneſs of <hi>London!</hi> the gluttony of <hi>London!</hi>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:41194:107"/>Is it not ſo? Again, the covetouſneſs of <hi>London:</hi> God was angry with <hi>Iſrael</hi> for being covetous; why, you covet gold more than grace; covet earth more than heaven. Oh the injuſtice, the wrong-getting, the lying, the perjury in getting of Eſtates! Oh the covetouſneſs in keeping, in not laying out proportionable to what God gave you to do good to others! God hath given you a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and you wrap it in a napkin; or which is worſe, you prodigally ſpend it upon your luſts, that make nothing of ten or twenty pounds to beſtow upon a vain feaſt, and grudg to give an Angel or twenty ſhillings for the help of any of the poor ſervants of God; is not this a ſin, do you think, when you are ſo liberal to your own luſts, and you are ſo heart-bound and hand-bound towards God and his people? yea certainly, and an highly provoking ſin too.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>London</hi>'s prophanation of the Lords-day: God all the time of the Law was very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for his Sabbath, and he had a Controverſie with <hi>Iſrael</hi> often upon the account of his Sabbath; and there are many Promiſes that he gave them to encourage them to keep his Sabbath: <hi>If thou wilt keep my Sabbaths, and count them thy delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable, I will make thee honourable and great in the world: but if not, I will pull thee down and deſtroy thee, and make thee the tail and not the head.</hi> Hath not this been one of <hi>London</hi>'s great ſins? How full of walkers have the ſtreets been on the Sabbath? how full have the fields about this City been on the Lords day? what playing, what drinking, what drunkenneſs at every
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41194:108"/>Alehouſe, eſpecially your by Alehouſes in <hi>London,</hi> and in the Fields? How few in <hi>London</hi> do ſtrictly obſerve the Lords-day? that pray with their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in the morning? that take care that their whole Family wait upon God all that day in his Ordinances, that when they come home at night, are careful to ſee what they profit by what they hear? How few are there in <hi>London</hi> that ſpend the Lords day as they ſhould do? God hath a Controverſie with you for this. What account can you Maſters, give of your ſervants ſouls? What care have you had over them, either all the week days, or elſe on the Lords day? What have you done for them? For your ſinful neglect here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, God is angry with you. For the adultery and uncleanneſs of <hi>London,</hi> for the whoredoms of <hi>Iſrael</hi> the land mourneth; for the whoredom of <hi>London, London</hi> was burnt. God puniſhed the City with one fire for the ſin of another, that is the fire of luſt. But, my Brethren, it is not barely theſe ſins that God hath been angry with <hi>London</hi> for, but for the aggravations of them. Why, wherein?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For the brazen-facedneſs of them; alas! we know that theſe ſins may be found every where: ay, but we are grown impudent ſinners, brazen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced ſinners, we are not aſhamed of our ſins; but we can be drunk with boldneſs, and commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and boaſt of it. We can ſin, as <hi>Abſalom</hi> lay with his Fathers Concubines, in the face of the Sun before all <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Here is the aggravation of the ſin now, it is not the drunkenneſs only of <hi>London,</hi> and ſwearing, and perjury, and Sabbath-breaking, but <hi>London</hi>'s ſhameleſneſs in it. As God when he came to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41194:108"/>reprove <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and threatens Judgments upon her, ſaith he, Thou haſt a brazen face, thou haſt the looks of an harlot, thou doſt ſin, and thou doſt not bluſh at it. Truly this hath been <hi>London</hi>'s ſin, they will ſwear and receive no reproof; be drunk and ſcorn a reproof; it is the very mode of the times to be drunk and commit adultery; ſobriety is laughed at; a ſcornful defiance is bid to the Law of God, and Miniſters have now much ado to perſwade men that theſe things are ſins. It is for <hi>London</hi>'s impudence in ſin that God burnt <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, they are not only the bare ſins of <hi>London,</hi> but God is angry with them for theſe ſins under the preaching of the Goſpel. Alas! if you were drunk, you might be drunk, and God never have burnt the City; if you ſwore and forſwore, and had been ſome of the <hi>Americans</hi> that had no Law, nor Prophets, nor Chriſt, nor Apoſtles, nor Miniſters, you might have ſworn and curſed, and God would have ſtood ſtill and let you alone, and only took a courſe with you at death, burned you then in Hell. But ſince God hath taken <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> for his people, and <hi>London</hi> for his people, and ſent Chriſt to be preached, and ſent Miniſters, and gifted them, and bid them cry, and cry aloud; believe it, God will not take your ſins as he takes the ſins of others. No, Sabbath-breaking is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſin in <hi>London</hi> than it is in the Northern parts of this Kingdom: Why, you have more means, you have the Goſpel in a greater light. And you Parents in <hi>London,</hi> and Maſters, for you to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect your Families, God taketh it worſe at your hands, than he doth at thoſe in the Country.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41194:109"/>Why? you ſhould know better: God hath given you more means to know the preciouſneſs of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and childrens ſouls, therefore you ſhould look more carefully after them. Your ſins are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt Goſpel-light, and therefore more dangerous, therefore God puniſhes you.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſins after vows of reformation: did <hi>London</hi> never promiſe God ſolemnly to reform? if you have forgotten it, God hath not. <hi>London</hi> hath been under a promiſe to reform: How to reform? to entertain Chriſt and the Goſpel, and to improve it better, to promote his Ordinances, and to reform their Families, every one in their places. If you have broken your Vows, and thrown them behind your backs, God is ſtill alive to puniſh for it. Ay, your ſins are greater too than others: Why? becauſe they are againſt more mercies, temporal mercies, in ſome reſpects, than the Countries about. In the time of the Civil War, when all the Country almoſt was laid waſt, <hi>London</hi> was not touched; there were Cities beſieged, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties burnt, Cities and Towns laid waſte and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, people beggered and undone every where. <hi>London</hi> did thrive all the while. God had a great reckoning with <hi>London. London!</hi> a people of ſo much means, ſo many mercies, ſo many deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo much of the Goſpel, and yet <hi>London,</hi> a drunken <hi>London,</hi> a covetous <hi>London,</hi> an adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>London!</hi> Believe it, God hath now at length reckoned with you, and hath begun to pay off your old and long ſcore, and I fear he hath not yet done with you. Chriſt hath been neglected, the Spirit grieved, Miniſters rejected, hated, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41194:109"/>Sabbaths prophaned, <hi>London</hi> full of pride, covetouſneſs, lying, ſwearing, luxury, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all theſe under the Goſpel, and all theſe committed with a brazen face, impudently; for theſe things God is angry with you; for theſe things God ſent the Peſtilence, for theſe things ſake God brought the fire.</p>
                  <p>If this be true, here is another Inference follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: Have our ſins burnt our City, and brought ſo many thouſands by the Peſtilence to the grave? Oh that we could be aſhamed of our ſins, confeſs them with ſhame, be humbled for our ſins, learn to hate our ſins, beg of God for grace to conquer our ſins. Oh that there might be a ſeparation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſin and us, that the great ſeparation between God and us may be prevented. Is God angry with <hi>London?</hi> it is for ſin: Oh be rid of your ſins, let us all this day ſearch our hearts, and try our reins, and ſee what iniquity is in us; what perſonal ſins, what Family-ſins, what City-ſins, what Church ſins; let us ſee how far we contributed to the burning of <hi>London;</hi> and Oh that we might by repentance and reformation crucifie thoſe ſins that burnt <hi>London;</hi> this would be a good work, and without this work, in vain do you faſt this day. God told <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they came faſting and mourning before him there in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> That they ſhould ceaſe to do evil and learn to do well, and then come and faſt and pray; and then faith he, <hi>Let us reaſon together,</hi> if you will ceaſe to do evil, and learn to do well, <hi>Though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow; though they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wool.</hi> So I
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41194:110"/>ſay in the name of the Lord to you this day, you are about praying to God that he would be at pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ce with <hi>London;</hi> let all of us ceaſe to do evil; what evils? thoſe evils that I have named: have any of us been guilty of <hi>London</hi>'s pride? the Lord help every one of us to reſolve for to crucifie that ſin, and to reſolve we will not have a hand any more in burning <hi>London.</hi> Which of you would not part with pride to ſave ſo great a City? let your ornaments be ſober as become men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men profeſſing Godlineſs. Thoſe that have been guilty of drunkenneſs, let them be drunk no more, take up that reſolution; thoſe that have been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of injuſtice in their callings, let them reſolve they will never more ſin to get an eſtate, and that they will rather live and die beggars. Believe it, that is not the way to die beggars if you come to reſolve upon it. For God can bleſs you in his way more than you can gain by walking in your own ſinful ways. Reſolve to lye no more, cozen no more, ſwear no more; are there any unclean? let them be unclean no more. Have you broken the Lords-day, and prophaned that, do ſo no more. Reſolve every one of you in your places, that for the future you and your Families, will endeavour to ſpend the whole Lords-day, in ſerving God, and looking after the Salvation of your Souls.</p>
                  <p>Again, take up a reſolution to give Chriſt a greater acceptation, a better acceptation; ſtand with your hearts wide open to the offers of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; do not neglect and ſlight Salvation when God offers it. When you deſpiſe his Son, you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41194:110"/>God himſelf: <hi>They that receive me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>receive him that ſent me:</hi> So thoſe that reject Chriſt, reject God the Father. When you come hither, and Chriſt is offered, and you will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain him, you reject God, you will not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain God. See that the Goſpel may come in its efficacy and power upon your ſouls. God is angry with every Citizen that hath not after all the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of Salvation, accepted of it. Every impenitent unconverted ſinner, becauſe of his impenitency and unconvertedneſs, he had a hand in the firing the City. Let us, I ſay, repent of our ſins, let us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thoſe ſins whereby we have provoked the Lord againſt us. But you will ſay, How if we ſhould? we ſhall leave thouſands, and ten thouſands that will not? What if we here reſolve to be ſober? how many will go on to be drunk? if we reſolve to keep the Lords-day, how many ſhall we find ſell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing next Lords-day in the fields or ſtreets, playing, and at Ale-houſes and Taverns drinking to drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs? What ſhall we do here? let not others wickedneſs diſcourage you to be good. Deſpair not, God doth not ſtand upon the repentance of a whole City, as to make it neceſſary for him to ſave it, or to ſave a Kingdom; but if there be any that do convert and turn, if there be any that do ſet themſelves to humble themſelves for the ſins of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and do intercede for Gods mercy in his ſtaying with a people, God will have reſpect to a City and a Kingdom for their ſake. Let us, and let all that fear the Lord this day up and down <hi>London,</hi> reſolve all to reform and bemoan the ſins of <hi>London</hi> before God, and therein become interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41194:111"/>for <hi>London,</hi> ſo we might prevent <hi>London</hi>'s ruin.</p>
                  <p>For a concluſion, let me add theſe encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to perſwade you to reform, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the generality of <hi>London</hi> will not reform ſtill.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe God will have you to reform, though others do not. God ſpeaketh to all to reform; do not you ſay I will not, becauſe others will not; it is thy duty, if others do not; thou doſt but thy duty when thou doſt it, though ten thouſands neglect it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly, God will take it better at thine hands if thou wilt reform in a wicked City, than if the whole City were generally good: Why? becauſe the ſervice is more difficult; it is an harder thing for a righteous <hi>Lot</hi> to live in a <hi>Sodom,</hi> than to live in a place where more godly perſons dwell. It is an eminent piece of ſervice, and an eminent teſtimony we give to God of our love to him, when we can ſerve him in a place where he is deſpiſed, his Laws broken, and he rebelled againſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3ly, Some of you muſt reform, or it is certain God will go on ſtill to be angry with <hi>London;</hi> and if God go on, wo unto us, ſurely it will be very bitter in the end. God hath not yet ſpent all his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom'd darts. He hath more and greater plagues than yet we have felt, and nothing but the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and heart-reformation, at leaſt of ſome of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41194:111"/>us, I ſay of ſome of us, that we may become fit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſors for the reſt, can prevent the pouring of them forth upon us. But you will ſay, Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to have greater, than to have an hundred thouſand ſwept away by the Peſtilence in one City, and in one year? than to have ſuch a famous City burnt down in three days? Yes. If God ſhould but ſuffer Popery to come in, it would be greater. If God ſhould bring in a company of bloody <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> that ſhould threaten you with burning, or elſe with provoking God by groſs Idolatry, you will ſay it is a greater; when you ſhall live in a <hi>London,</hi> and in <hi>England,</hi> and not hear of Chriſt Jeſus preached to you from one end of the year to the other, I think it will be a plague; and to have it brought in too by a foreign enemy. No, perhaps you will ſay, God will never do ſo. This was <hi>Iſraels</hi> old preſumption: What, God that brought us out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he deſtroy us! What! that God that hath known us, and hath been our God, and hath ſignified himſelf our God by many mercies! He that walked with us, and we with him, he ſend a foreign enemy! it is impoſſible. Do not deceive your ſelves, God was as much engaged to the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> as to <hi>London,</hi> as to <hi>England;</hi> and what he hath done, he can do again. This is one of the greateſt Judgments that can befall the Land, if God ſhould take away the Goſpel, leave us in darkneſs and blindneſs, take the Candleſtick away, and give us up to Idolatry, and ſay as to <hi>Ephraim, He is joined to Idols, let him alone.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, reform, leſt worſe things come upon you.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41194:112"/>Let the Lord ſee you after this day that you are a more careful, watchful, circumſpect people in the whole courſe of your lives and converſations; and if ſo, doubtleſs God will have this day an ear open to your prayer; he will have an heart ready to pity you, and to compaſſionate you when you cry; you ſhall be numbred among thoſe Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors that have ſtood in the gap, that have kept wrath from coming in upon <hi>England,</hi> to the utter ruin of it.</p>

               <p>WHAT mean theſe drooping groans, and this languor of thy ſpirits, as if thou hadſt neither life nor heat! What's become of thy won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted joy, and magnanimity in the courſe of thy <hi>Miniſtry?</hi> Thou lookeſt and ſeemeſt as if a weary of thy work! what is the cauſe? Is it that Gods glory is leſs, that thou car'ſt not whether he is honoured or diſhonoured by men? or what is it? That he is not ſo good to theee as formerly? Haſt thou not meat, drink and cloaths as freely and fully as ever? Is thine health or ſtrength abated? Or is the Throne of Grace, or the way to it ſhut up? Is God angry with thee? This were cauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but nothing elſe, if thou enjoyeſt this. Or what is it? that thou canſt not ſee theſe ſo well, his honour, and theſe mercies are ſo much prized? Oh! none of theſe are the cauſe; Gods glory is the ſame, and his mercies they are continued, and conſtant to me as ever. And it's not becauſe I want a relliſh of them. I do not ſerve an hard Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that makes me weary of ſerving him. Why, what then is the matter? Hath he recalled his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or denied himſelf, and abated thy wages? Oh! no, Heaven and earth ſhall paſs away, but not a tittle of his word; and let God be true though
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41194:113"/>all elſe be lyars. What is it? are the ſouls of men leſs precious, or their eternal life and ſafety now leſs dangerous? Is fire leſs hot, and Hell leſs tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting? Are not the joys of Heaven ſo much to be deſired? and ſo is the work of the Miniſtry leſs needful? Is not the caſe the ſame to deliver men from ſo many burning coals, as when <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> preached? Art thou then weary? Oh! no, my ſtrength's the ſame. But Oh! I am unprofitable to my God, I am <hi>ſlighted,</hi> they wonder I can come into a Pulpit, and have no more to ſay! How! and is that me a poor worm! and wilt thou be thus cruſht with ſuch a ſtraw, and loſe thy ſpirits under ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible weight!</p>
               <p n="1">(1) And didſt thou not expect to meet with ſuch things before? who bid thee go, and ſet thee on this work, and promis'd thee every hour a word? waſt not told, thou ſhouldſt be perſecuted, <hi>ſlighted,</hi> ſcoffed at? And was it not <hi>predicted,</hi> there ſhould be <hi>ſcoffers in the laſt times,</hi> as in the firſt? Why didſt not think of this before? a wiſe man would have done it.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) And was not <hi>God</hi> himſelf <hi>ſlighted</hi> by thoſe that were invited to the feaſt? Was not Chriſt worſe than <hi>ſlighted?</hi> and was not <hi>Paul</hi> called a <hi>Babler?</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel fooliſhneſs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3) But conſider further, Is not the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and the God of it ſlighted in thee? the meſſage thou knoweſt is not <hi>thine,</hi> but <hi>his</hi> that ſent thee.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) And think, is it not natural for the <hi>carnal</hi> mind to have unſavoury, dark, fooliſh thoughts of the <hi>Goſpel?</hi> was it not always ſo? did not Chriſt wonder, ſeeing their unbelief?</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:41194:113"/>(5) But think, it's <hi>God in Chriſt,</hi> or the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and <hi>ſpiritualneſs</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> that they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value, and think nothing of the excellency of.

                  <l>The churliſh winds, and now the grumbling waves</l>
                  <l>They do petition, and their mercy craves.</l>
                  <l>Their ſaileleſs Ship now helpt with wind and tide,</l>
                  <l>More ſlow, yet with more jolting trots doth ride;</l>
                  <l>Like pamper'd ſteeds now great curvets doth take,</l>
                  <l>Yet no great riddance in their journey make.</l>
                  <l>Now you might ſee a billow ſtooping low</l>
                  <l>To take its burthen on its back below,</l>
                  <l>Which ſtraight with ſwift career ſhe lifts on high</l>
                  <l>With ſuch a noiſe, as if 'twould ſtorm the sky.</l>
                  <l>The ancient <hi>Gyants</hi> once a war would wage</l>
                  <l>With God, 'gainſt whom a <hi>Babel</hi> in their rage</l>

                  <l>But ſoon the billow with Ship both fall down,</l>
                  <l>Like horſe and rider, tumbling, ſhake the ground.</l>
                  <l>Now you would think in ſome deep pit they lay,</l>
                  <l>And that they ne're again ſhould ſee the day:</l>
                  <l>Or that the watry walls whoſe tops paſt ſight</l>
                  <l>Would have confin'd them to eternal night.</l>
                  <l>Thus in their ſwimming priſon up they're toſt,</l>

                  <l>Thus lay the Ship a tipling night and day</l>
                  <l>Up <hi>Neptune</hi>'s Nectar, reeling every way;</l>
                  <l>Both ſides and ſtern, and keel do drink amain,</l>
                  <l>And out by pumps they ſpew it up again.</l>
                  <l>The Mariners to know each others minds,</l>
                  <l>With ſhouts do mingle voices with the winds;</l>
                  <l>Now under deck, now up again, they call</l>
                  <l>Now for this thing, and then for that they bawl;</l>
                  <l>Such great confuſions in their voices ſeem,</l>
                  <l>That th' Ship a <hi>Babel</hi> one would truly deem.</l>
                  <l>At length by ſigns they do at once agree,</l>
                  <l>T' unlade the Ship of all its trumpery;</l>
                  <l>Out fly the Trunks, the Cheſts, the Feather-beds,</l>
                  <l>The Bolſters, Pillows where they laid their heads.</l>
                  <l>Though they had boxes ſtuſt with maſſie Gold,</l>
                  <l>Or Pearls, or Diamonds, out they muſt be roll'd:</l>
                  <l>Sweet life! ſweet life! nothing is thought too brave</l>
                  <l>For to redeem thee from a loathed grave.</l>
                  <l>Thus like a ſcatter'd troop that's put to flight,</l>
                  <l>They throw down all to make themſelves more light:</l>
                  <l>Down falls the Musket, 'way the Pike is twirld;</l>
                  <l>Off goes the Scabbard, 'way the Sword is hurl'd;</l>
                  <l>Here flies their Hats, there their ſhoos do lie;</l>
                  <l>Nothing they care or fear, but leſt they die.</l>
                  <l>Or like a bird with prey, when in a fright,</l>
                  <l>Lets fall the prey, and takes her ſelf to flight.</l>
                  <l>The Ship far lighter than ſhe was before,</l>
                  <l>For one curvet ſhe now doth take a ſcore,</l>
                  <l>To the winds whiſtling ſhe doth dance apace,</l>
                  <l>Till th' briny ſweats run down her wooden face.</l>
                  <l>Yet for all this the Ship a burden feels,</l>
                  <l>That hung as clogs about her nimble heels:</l>

                  <l>And them with ſail-yards in the Sea they throw.</l>
                  <l>Fourteen long tedious nights, as many days,</l>

                  <l>About his lips of a deep carrot-die.</l>

                  <l>Thus with grave countenance, as it was fit,</l>
                  <l>He fetcht a hum, and then moſt gravely ſpit,</l>
                  <l>Nodding his head on one ſide, then on t'other,</l>
                  <l>He thus began to ſpeak unto each brother:</l>
                  <l>Genteels, you know, <hi>Epheſians</hi> were your Sires,</l>
                  <l>And that you had your breeding 'mong the fires;</l>

                  <l>Of your divine and noble occupation</l>

                  <l>If this Sect do encreaſe, it will be ſo?</l>

                  <l>Did not our anceſtors her e're adore?</l>

                  <l>That ſhe be worſhipt, and before her bow?</l>
                  <l>That her rich Temple (is it not much pity!)</l>
                  <l>Should now at length be ſlighted by this City!</l>

                  <l>The only feeble argument that he</l>
                  <l>Doth urge to us, is that no Deity</l>

                  <l>I am no Sophy, yet an anſwer I</l>
                  <l>Will give to this poor ſilly fallacy.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Diana</hi> is a Deity you know,</l>
                  <l>And mans hands made her, tell me, i'nt it ſo?</l>

                  <l>To this I anſwer him, I never yet</l>
                  <l>Studied the point. But I will never let</l>
                  <l>My Goddeſs and my trade go down together;</l>
                  <l>But right or wrong, I do not much care whether.</l>
                  <l>That you are of the very ſelf-ſame mind,</l>
                  <l>I hope this day by your warm zeal to find.</l>
                  <l>When this long ſpeech he ſweetly forth had ſtut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd,</l>

                  <l>Theſe things thus ſpoken by <hi>Demetrius,</hi>

                  <l>Tuck up their aprons, and do ſhrug the ſhoulder,</l>
                  <l>Run from their Maſters, whither, never told her:</l>
                  <l>Throwing their arms, and moving legs apace,</l>
